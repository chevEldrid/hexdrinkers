For those of you just joining me, welcome! Check out part 1 of this analysis where I cover aggro and tribal decks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexdrinkers.com/historically%20speaking/2020/09/09/historic2-1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Same as before, I’ve broken down the decks under these broader archetypes. I’ll only be covering the most prominent decks in the meta, we’ll save the brewing for later wink wink. So without further adieu, let’s finish our grand tour! “Midrange” Decks Midrange is a contentious term nowadays, with recent pushes in power seemingly squeezing it out of most formats, especially recent Standards. However, I’m using it to refer to decks that don’t go as low and fast as the aggro (or tribal) decks and are more proactive than the control decks we’ll discuss later. Golgari Sacrifice Artifacts 4x Bolas&#39;s Citadel Creatures 4x Blood Artist 3x Gilded Goose 2x Jadelight Ranger 4x Llanowar Elves 3x Llanowar Visionary 2x Paradise Druid 4x Priest of Forgotten Gods 2x Scavenging Ooze 4x Woe Strider Enchantments 2x Bastion of Remembrance Instants 4x Collected Company Lands 6x Forest 4x Overgrown Tomb 2x Phyrexian Tower 6x Swamp 4x Woodland Cemetery This deck represents a few different strands of a powerful sacrifice core. Tied together with Collected Company it often grinds value until it can pull off a pseudo-combo kill with Bolas’s Citadel . In general they’re Golgari, though some versions move towards Abzan, some towards Jund. Don’t worry if this sounds like a lot, we’ll go into the unique flavors of this build a little later but for right now let’s talk about the foundation they all have in common. The sacrifice core of this deck features the likes of Woe Strider , Priest of Forgotten Gods , and Blood Artist , among others. In their purest essence, these decks want to churn through their libraries using sacrifice value and eventually drain their opponents out with a Blood Artist effect. Woe Strider is another integral piece, providing a free sacrifice outlet which is absolutely key, giving you a goat to get the engines started, and can recur itself if you run out of gas. It also allows you to scry with each sacrifice as well which keeps the gas rolling, especially for Bolas’s Citadel , more on that later. Oh, also, Phyrexian Tower is a powerful Magic Card. The other all star of this deck is Priest of Forgotten Gods . It’s key in removing opposing creatures, especially something out of the Auras deck, or a lone Muxus, Goblin Grandee with the trigger on the stack. If you can get a Priest and some fodder out early, you can often keep your opponent off creatures for several turns, giving you the time you need to assemble your engine or just beat down. Lastly, the Priest draws (always good) and that double black mana boost can help on key multi-spell turns or for powering out a Citadel. Along with these sacrifice-based cards, the deck plays a whole suite of mana dorks like Llanowar Elves , Gilded Goose , and Llanowar Visionary . These ramp/fix you and also are prime sacrifice fodder when you need to get down to brass tacks. They tend to be unsatisfactory hits off Collected Company , but they’re a necessary evil and two mediocre hits are better than no hits. Finally, let’s discuss the hulking monstrosity in the room… Bolas’s Citadel . Much like Muxus, Goblin Grandee in Goblins, Citadel is the “I Win” card in Golgari Sac. With the draining effects of something like Blood Artist and low average CMC, you can tear through the top of your deck with little concern for your life, scrying away lands with Woe Strider . Dump enough creatures onto the board and sacrifice them for a machine gun effect to decimate your opponent’s life total. Sometimes you won’t be able to pull off the full combo and close out the game, but you’ll often be able to establish a healthy board presence and set up for a kill next turn. Variations on a (Sacrificial) Theme Now that we’ve discussed the basics of the deck, let’s hit on the different flavors real quick. Golgari is of course the most straightforward. They get to run all the dorks, a full four-of Bolas’s Citadel , and Bastion of Remembrance alongside Blood Artist for drain. They also get some flex slots where you might put a Jadelight Ranger or Nightmare Shepherd . This version is clean and tuned. It won’t have mana problems and it wants to bust out a Citadel as soon as possible to go off. Simple and effective, but its Company hits are the weakest on average and most importantly it isn’t … flashy. Jund versions of this deck trim their Citadels and often forego Blood Artist entirely to form a shell much akin to the Jund Food deck of recent Standards (a personal favorite deck of mine, check out this gameplay). Mayhem Devil is an A+ card in a shell such as this being able to remove blockers, clear fodder for a Priest of Forgotten Gods activation, or of course just pinging face. Alongside the Devil is good old Cat / Oven to make sure you’re maximizing that damage. I’ve seen lists run Bonecrusher Giant for value and Claim the Firstborn depending on how disruptive they want to be, but Mayhem Devil is one hundred percent worth the splash. Lastly, there are Abzan versions. These are probably my least favorite as they don’t gain enough for the mana inconsistency. The only white inclusions (at least in the main deck) is Cruel Celebrant , which is an excellent Blood Artist replacement or supplement, but doesn’t have the versatility that Mayhem Devil does. This deck is one of the most versatile in the meta and can take several different lines depending on the opponent. However, similar to Elves from pt 1, it can falter when you draw the wrong half of your deck. All mana dorks does you no good, and only having your payoffs won’t let you establish your engine as you’re sacrificing everything. Also, the “randomness” of your most powerful engines, Collected Company and Bolas’s Citadel can cause you to miss or stall out and that can often prove fatal. Too many times I’ve gotten my opponent down to two or three life and then hit double lands off the top with Citadel. Just as many times, I’ve needed a reasonable Company to retake board dominance and fuel a Priest, and I hit… a single measly Llanowar Elves . Feels bad man. And of course, any quick deck with good spot-removal can take out your key pieces (Strider, Priest, Devil) as you’re setting up and totally halt any progress. That being said, the raw power of your pieces and the adaptability of the deck will truly reward dedicated and detail-oriented play. Gruul Artifacts 2x Embercleave Creatures 4x Bonecrusher Giant 2x Earthshaker Khenra 4x Gruul Spellbreaker 1x Klothys, God of Destiny 4x Llanowar Elves 4x Lovestruck Beast 2x Pelt Collector 1x Rhonas the Indomitable 4x Robber of the Rich 4x Scavenging Ooze Instants 4x Collected Company Sorceries 2x Primal Might Lands 8x Forest 5x Mountain 4x Rootbound Crag 1x Sheltered Thicket 4x Stomping Ground Much less complicated than the previous set of decks, Gruul probably shouldn’t even be considered a midrange deck. A statement to how powerful aggro is in this format, Gruul is merely a midrange deck because it goes bigger and is a bit more resilient than your typical aggro deck. Shockingly similar to Gruul aggro/midrange in Standard (did you know they printed powerful cards this last year?) it often curves Pelt Collector into Robber of the Rich into Lovestruck Beast into Questing Beast , often with an Embercleave not far behind. Fat and hasty threats are the name of the game. Most of these cards don’t need any explaining, they’re just big and good at attacking. I will break down some of the more important ones though: Questing Beast continues to be a thorn in many players’ side, just like in Standard, and with the presence of a lot of low to the ground creature decks is usually unblockable. Chipping in for a free four damage a turn with vigilance to wall most things in the format is nasty. Robber of the Rich is a cheap, hasty threat, and since a lot of the interaction in this format is cheap and powerful, he can easily turn an opponent’s Thoughtsieze or Opt against them. Collected Company is back (go figure) and gets the most powerful cards pound for pound in this deck. Bonecrusher Giant , Lovestruck Beast , Gruul Spellbreaker , and Rhonas, the Indomitable all clock in at three mana, but with stats that hit far above that weight class. It’s like when the opposing team’s pitcher in Little League is 6 ft and 200 lbs. Except there’s two of them, they teleport into battle like damn ninja, they may or may not be vicious bestial humanoids, and you aren’t playing baseball. The last card I want to highlight is Primal Might . At worst it’s a one mana fight spell, which since your creatures are all huge, is just a straight up removal spell. But when the game is going long, you can pump up your creature to astronomical heights, remove their best blocker, and go to town. Add in trample from Rhonas, the Indomitable and you just close the game out right there! The biggest thing this deck has going for it is the raw POWER of each of its cards. There isn’t really any synergy, just the most efficient threats, pound for pound. Mana dorks to accelerate you and beaters at every point along the curve keep the pressure on while Collected Company refills you and Embercleave punches through defenses like a gaddang battering ram. You even get a bit of removal with Stomp and Primal Might , plus whatever Robber of the Rich might snag. RG monsters is back and man does it feel good. Control Decks Lastly, but not leastly, ye olde control decks. My personal favorite archetype, I was disappointed with control’s place in the meta. With the prominence of aggro decks and midrange decks that could be considered aggro decks, it’s hard for control to maintain a home, and of those I’ll mention, I’d really only consider one a true control deck. Sultai Ramp Creatures 4x Hydroid Krasis 4x Uro, Titan of Nature&#39;s Wrath Instants 2x Aether Gust 3x Eliminate 4x Growth Spiral 2x Heartless Act 1x Pact of Negation Sorceries 2x Extinction Event 1x Languish 1x Maelstrom Pulse 4x Thoughtseize Planeswalkers 4x Nissa, Who Shakes the World 1x Vraska, Golgari Queen Lands 4x Breeding Pool 1x Castle Locthwain 3x Drowned Catacomb 3x Fabled Passage 1x Fetid Pools 2x Forest 1x Hinterland Harbor 2x Island 4x Overgrown Tomb 2x Swamp 4x Zagoth Triome First, Sultai. I honestly hate this deck. It’s incredibly close to the Sultai of Standard that’s been dominant in some variation for nearly a year. You play your Growth Spiral s and Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath s, ramp to a Nissa, Who Shakes the World , and then play a humongous Hydroid Krasis to stabilize your life and completely refill your hand. You also get basically all the best interaction in Thoughtseize , Eliminate , and Aether Gust . The thing that I don’t like about this deck is there aren’t really any good play patterns and there isn’t any real decision-making. All your cards are stupidly powerful and can grind your opponent into oblivion. If something gets removed or countered, you already have enough backup to brush it off. Stick one threat and it can easily close the game. The only real decision is the number of Languish s or Extinction Event s you run, which by the way are the best sweepers in the format (and this includes freaking Wrath of God ). The list I’ve posted is generic, but feel free to customize your counterspell and removal suite. As long as you’re running four-ofs of Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath , Nissa, Who Shakes the World , Hydroid Krasis , and Thoughtseize , you pretty much can’t go wrong. I’m done with this deck, let’s move onto something better. Come get me Uro fans. Orzhov Yorion Companion Yorion, Sky Nomad Creatures 4x Burglar Rat 4x Charming Prince 2x Gonti, Lord of Luxury 2x Ravenous Chupacabra Enchantments 4x Demonic Pact 4x Doom Foretold 2x Elspeth Conquers Death 2x Elspeth&#39;s Nightmare 4x Oath of Kaya 1x The Eldest Reborn 4x Treacherous Blessing 3x Trial of Ambition Instants 2x Final Payment 3x Flicker of Fate 2x Mortify Sorceries 4x Thoughtseize Lands 2x Barren Moor 1x Castle Ardenvale 2x Castle Locthwain 4x Godless Shrine 4x Isolated Chapel 7x Plains 2x Secluded Steppe 7x Swamp 4x Temple of Silence A deck I don’t see super often on the ladder, Orzhov Yorion is one of the most interesting decks in the meta. It’s also one of the most fun to pilot and one of the most miserable to play against, but whatever. Functioning around blinking powerful enchantments (and y’all know how much I love enchantments), this deck’s pinnacle is establishing a loop with Yorion, Sky Nomad and Charming Prince . Yorion, Sky Nomad (as a Companion and in the maindeck) provides mass blink to all your hateful pieces. Charming Prince provides a way to rebuy your Yorions and if you can keep them both alive, they cycle in and out in a sort of lock to continually reset all your enchantments. The outcome? Your opponent has no permanents and no cards in hand. Nice. In terms of enchantments, we have all of the best. Elspeth is really coming in swinging between Elspeth Conquers Death and Elspeth’s Nightmare , both very powerful includes. They both do exactly what you want: removal and resource denial, whether that’s cards in hand, cards in graveyard, or taxing the opponent’s mana. Then, as the dust is clearing, you’ll get to reanimate a fallen Yorion to renew your opponent’s subscription to poundtown. Trial of Ambition and The Eldest Reborn provide spicy repeatable options to make your opponent sacrifice, which is key against any decks packing protection. Oath of Kaya provides a repeatable Lightning Helix effect, and while it helps keep our opponent from having permanents (in case you couldn’t tell, that’s the plan), it also goes to the face and can close out games. The two crown jewels of this deck are Doom Foretold and Demonic Pact . Doom Foretold is Trial or Eldest on steroids and won’t stop until your opponent has no permanents and that sacrifice trigger is the final nail in the coffin. Often the best option for an opponent who doesn’t have an abundance of nonland permanents already is to just sandbag and wait for the Foretold to pop, which gives us time to set up even more lock pieces and strip any chance of our opponent from winning, by playing something like a Demonic Pact . Demonic Pact does everything we could ever want. We can pick off creatures, refill our hand, and even more important in this deck, deny our opponents resources. Then before that pesky fourth choice comes around, we just blink it and get back to the sweet, sweet value. Or we cast Final Payment and sacrifice it, another sweet line of tech. Either way, what I’m trying to say is demonic pacts are fun and don’t pose us a liability. Highly recommend. The final part of this deck that I think is great is its customizability. Yes, I love enchantments, and there’s already plenty of great options, but if you want to go for a more creature-centric build you can! Ravenous Chupacabra is a great addition to merk anything and everything while Burglar Rat provides your discard effect. This deck can be slow to start and definitely demands more thought intensive lines of play, but the sheer off-the-wall construction of the deck, getting to play a deck essentially devoid of staples, and the utter domination that comes from pulling out a win with this deck is worth it. Azorius Control Enchantments 3x The Birth of Meletis 1x Cast Out 2x Seal Away 2x Search for Azcanta 3x Shark Typhoon Instants 1x Blink of an Eye 4x Censor 2x Dovin&#39;s Veto 3x Hieroglyphic Illumination 2x Pact of Negation 1x Settle the Wreckage 2x Sphinx&#39;s Revelation Planeswalkers 2x Narset, Parter of Veils 3x Teferi, Hero of Dominaria Sorceries 3x Wrath of God Lands 2x Castle Ardenvale 3x Field of Ruin 4x Glacial Fortress 4x Hallowed Fountain 4x Plains 3x Irrigated Farmland 6x Island Finally, we’ve come to the end. My favorite deck in my favorite archetype. Good ol’ Azorius Draw-Go Control. The only true control deck in this article and pretty much the only tiered control deck in the meta, this harkons to the glory days of the archetype. Rife with counterspells, removal, card advantage, and a noticeable lack of win-conditions, I love this deck. But it isn’t really that good. It’s inherently reactive by nature, counter/remove your opponent’s threats until they don’t have any. Then you can think about slowly winning through something like a Shark Typhoon or Castle Ardenvale . With so much of the meta being hyper-proactive and able to go wayyyy under this deck, testing was rough. The upside is you can answer pretty much anything. Censor and Dovin’s Veto continue to be excellent counter spells with Pact of Negation allowing for you to tap out on crucial turns with back up. Cast Out and Seal Away both exile with the former able to hit problematic permanents. Settle the Wreckage is a great safety valve, especially against something like Goblins and Wrath of God continues to prove why it is the OG. Opponents can’t afford to overcommit to the board against this deck. Azorius Control also packs the best raw card advantage. Hieroglyphic Illumination was an excellent pickup with its ability to scale. Narset, Parter of Veils continues to dig way farther than she should and Search for Azcanta is amazing in the late game when it flips. Lastly, Sphinx’s Revelation is in this deck. I think that’s all I need to say, that card slaps. Finally, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria aka “Scourge of Dominaria Standard” tops off our deck. This is generally our best card and can run away with the game if we stick him. He does basically everything. However, I think the sad truth is that this just isn’t enough anymore. Even with some of the best control cards ever printed, I don’t think trading one for one with the opponent is going to cut it in today’s format. Even with the best sideboard cards in the entire meta, being reactive instead of proactive often can’t compete. I’ll continue to play this deck cause I love it, but I wouldn’t take this to a tournament anytime soon. A Challenger Approaches Well, that concludes the second and final part of this metagame analysis! I hope you enjoyed and learned something so you can go out and crush those queues. Let us know on Twitter or in the comments below which of these decks you’re loving (or hating) and if you’ve found any tweaks that give you the edge in your match-ups. Stay tuned for the next installment of Historically Speaking where we begin to stray from the beaten path and do what the Crew does best… BREW!

For the rest, here’s the breakdown!&lt;/p&gt; There’s something wonderful about playing mono-color in commander. Nowadays there are so many “must-play” cards being added to the format (looking at you Arcane Signet ) that it can feel the more colors you play, the less room you have to add your commander’s unique package. Think about the infrastructure required to get a rainbow deck going compared to a color combination that’s less mana-taxing. Monocolor doesn’t exactly get rid of all the required cards, every color has them, but playing with less colors means there are fewer cards you feel compelled to play. Of course there is a downside. Playing with only one color means you really are beholden to the restrictions of that color. Red can’t deal with enchantments, White doesn’t really draw cards, Green has a hard time losing games. Things have to be kept balanced! Joking aside, this week I want to take a look at my FAVORITE monocolor style, ever since I purchased the Sworn to Darkness C14 precon. Mono-black. Welcome back to Homebrewed, it’s been a while. I have to fit article-writing in between relaxing on the beach and enjoying the California sun so it’s been tough you know? Don’t worry, it’ll be worth the wait, I promise. As you might have picked up, The Hexdrinkers have been doing weekly game nights as a way to test out new strategies and build ideas in a real setting while also being able to stay close and of course, play Magic. The past couple weeks I’ve strayed from my typical rotation of Hapatra shenanigans, Eldrazi nonsense, and Coin-Flip insanity to a different deck: Toshiro Umezawa . This incredibly unique commander from Betrayers of Kamigawa (In fact, isn’t he THE Betrayer? I’ll have to check with Eric…) really encourages a unique playstyle for Black. I mean yes it’s wrapped in murdering as many creatures as possible, but you don’t often see Black reanimating anything but creatures. Focusing on instants gets you at LEAST double the murder mayhem. Plus, Black has some real surprise cards that’ll have people scratching their heads as to why they were allowed to exist. You’ll love this deck if: You’re a spellslinger trying to branch out of Izzet You love having answers to your opponents’ nasty creatures 90% of the time You like having multiple play avenues at any given time (Editor’s note: Don’t we all…?) You want to give green ramp a run for its money Maybe this deck isn’t quite for you if: You’re looking to take advantage of Black’s creature suite You want the love and affection of anyone else at the table You prefer a more linear playstyle. Well. Ish. Okay so it’s linear in the “kill a creature, re-cast a kill spell, kill another creature, until the mana runs dry” kinda way. But there’s some surprising versatility there! …Although now I say that out loud it sounds kinda murder-y… Permanents are your friends The best way I have to describe this build is Black Spellslinger. It wouldn’t be wrong to say you’re trying to cast at least one instant per turn once Toshiro hits the board, and squeezing every last trigger out of the recently deceased. Also an advance warning: the first few times you whip this out you WILL misplay. I’m still doing it. There are so many options at any given time that unless you give it your full attention, you’ll be leaving value on the table. And that’s a really good thing!! Honestly, most of my decks run a little on the janky side so having something more interesting is scratching an itch I didn’t know I had! With that - on to the build! Kill la Kill Funnily enough the core of this deck is also the part that’s most ripe for experimentation. Black is obviously rife with creature removal so your options for which pieces to run are almost endless. Here I’ve decided to highlight just a couple of my favorites. But hey! “Y’all do y’all”, as Julian would say. Curtains’ Call is from that Commander 2016 cycle of cards that has Undaunted, aka they cost less for each opponent you have. I don’t think I’ve ever seen any others played outside of Sublime Exhalation but destroying two target creatures for (usually) 3 mana is a steal. This is also your first reminder that any kill spell that pulls double duty results in TWO triggers for Toshiro, so use that as you will. (Fun rules fact: You can target an instant you just cast to destroy a creature with the resulting Toshiro trigger. So something like Malicious Affliction can be cast from your hand to kill one thing, targeted with Toshiro’s ability, and then be cast from the yard to kill two more thanks to Morbid. Food for thought.) Snuff Out along with Slaughter Pact (and to a lesser extent Deadly Rollick - cause it exiles) can be cast for 0 when you need them and boy oh boy, coming across one copy of these can be annoying enough but two?? That’s a potential of six free pieces of targeted removal per game. Drag to the Underworld is nothing special, but due to its recent printing it might not show up as high on usage charts. I’m here on its behalf to remind you that with Toshiro out this will just cost double black and be a very cost efficient removal spell Outside of instants, might I also suggest the following for your death triggers? Turns out Black’s pretty good at wiping things out at sorcery speed too… Boardwipes are a critical part of any EDH build, and here they pull double duty. One-sided wraths like In Garruk’s Wake will clear the way for your army of darkness and give Toshiro a bounty of triggers, while more symmetrical wipes like Damnation will still allow Toshiro to “see” everything else dying which you can utilize for some more instants. What more could you want! Feed the Swarm is Black’s first foray into targeted enchantment removal which has been one of Black’s weaknesses since the beginning so while it can destroy creatures, it’ll probably be used for the other mode more often than not. The Other Spells When you’re not raining hellfire, sometimes you need spells that do OTHER things. I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes you’ll want these even more than kill spells. Succumb to Temptation is one of the only Black draw spells at instant speed outside of Wretched Confluence . Can you believe that?? Either way, I cannot think of a game I haven’t cast this twice and been all the better for it. Withering Boon and Imp’s Mischief fall flatly in the category of “Wait, Black can do that???” An Essence Scatter for an additional 3 measly life? Of course! I’ve found people will expect the Spanish Inquisition more than the mono black player to have a response to their creature. Imp’s Mischief is the same deal; not necessarily a counter, but at least it’ll redirect someone’s malicious intent… or steal a game-winning spell. Either way, use it! Death by 1000 Pings Toshiro gives each creature death fantastic utility - but this is Black! He shouldn’t be the only one out there basking in the misery of others! That’s where the squad comes in. Pick your favorites. I know there will be Blood Artist or Bastion of Remembrance fans out there but for me I’ve gotta go with these guys: Syr Konrad, the Grim and Massacre Wurm have each won me games with this build. Sometimes from wiping out solid boardstates flinging fast and furious instants or a well-timed In Garruk’s Wake , but in every case, the pings really add up. As for Reaper from the Abyss …well taking down an extra creature per turn is icing on an already scrumptious cake. But for what we’re really trying to accomplish, those guys are just the beginning. Let me introduce you to our real game-winners. Literally the dynamic Duo, Revel in Riches has an alternate wincon that is easily achievable in just a couple turns. Even if it gets taken out, odds are you’re up on mana from when you cast it. Black Market is an older flavor, but even more potent in the mana generation department once it really gets a fat stack of counters, something we’re happy to assist and provide. Some games I’ve been able to cast my entire hand without touching my landbase. Big Mana This is a pretty typical package, but for those of you that don’t know, Black can pull off some absolutely heinous stuff when it comes to mana generation. Mostly it’s due to two key cards and their variants: Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth and Cabal Coffers . We run both along with Expedition Map . Basically, with both are on the field all your lands become swamps and then you can just tap two to activate Cabal Coffers to add mana equal to your entire land count to your mana pool. This is, how you say, broken. And your friends will hate it. I’ve also added Coffers’ little brother Cabal Stronghold and Manascape Refractor for redundancy. Most games, you’ll end up with more mana than you know what to do with, which is perfect for a game-winning Torment of Hailfire . Oh and if you’re really feeling it, toss in a Thespian’s Stage or a Magus of the Coffers for good measure. You’ll thank me. Final Shoutouts While most cards fit nicely into boxes, there are a couple I want to give special attention to for their continued support in this deck’s ability to wreck face. Primal Amulet is a fun way to trick opponents into thinking you probably can’t cast anything with the one mana you have open and then BAM! Heartless Act . But what’s even better is when you flip it…Yes, you read Primal Wellspring right. In a deck with such a high instant count this gets exponential quickly as it doubles our Toshiro triggers as well. I quickly realized why there’s been a greater push for land destruction in EDH. Sangromancer brought me back from the brinks of Hell in a couple games. Not only does murdering everything kind of paint a target on your back, but to utilize things like Phyrexian Arena and Necropotence you’re going to be losing a fair bit of life. Given a few turns, Sangromancer can turn all that around. Gravebreaker Lamia is not only Entomb on a stick, but also makes our Toshiro triggers that much more efficient and attainable. Oooo boy. Conclusion And that’s it! A powerful Black commander that can bring the hurt consistently and provide a greater challenge to pilot than what I usually bring to the table. I highly recommend giving Toshiro a look and drawing a few sample hands. You won’t look back… For the full list, pop over here!

History isn’t written overnight and I’ve been taking my time to test many decks from the meta and playing against even more. I came out victorious in many battles, but I also did a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of losing (hence the title, and also cause I wanted to continue the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; references). It wasn’t all for naught though. After all that struggle, I think I’ve finally come up with a comprehensive overview of what’s out there as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each deck.&lt;/p&gt; I’ve broken down the decks under broad archetypes and then will discuss specific decks within and close out with more broad conclusions. But with so much to cover, I think it’s best to just jump right in! Tribal Decks There are three notable tribal decks in the format, uncoincidentally, some that have had the longest and most successful histories in Magic: Goblins, Elves, and Merfolk. All three have a plethora of good creatures to choose from as well as a healthy selection of lords and can be held together by one of the pillars of the format, Collected Company . Merfolk Companion Jegantha, the Wellspring Creatures 4x Benthic Biomancer 4x Deeproot Elite 4x Kumena&#39;s Speaker 4x Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca 4x Merfolk Mistbinder 4x Merrow Reejerey 4x Mist-Cloaked Herald 4x Silvergill Adept Instants 4x Collected Company Lands 4x Breeding Pool 4x Forest 2x Hashep Oasis 4x Hinterland Harbor 8x Island 2x Temple of Mystery Merfolk is arguably the weakest at the moment. It does benefit from access to Collected Company , but it’s still really just a deck from Ixalan Standard, “a notoriously less powerful standard (especially compared to the last year cough cough”). Merfolk Mistbinder and Merrow Reejerey are both high quality lords. Silvergill Adept helps keep a stream of merfolk to play. Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca is a phenomenal payoff as well as a crucial engine to make the deck run. She’s definitely the most powerful card in the deck and luckily with four toughness is harder to kill due to the prevalence of Shock and three-damage burn spells. Deeproot Elite can buff up your merfolk though it takes a bit longer than is acceptable in this format and can get removed quickly. In the early game, Merfolk lack the explosive mana generation of Elves or Goblins to establish a dominating board presence quickly. While they can build up an impressive army and beat out other generic creature deck, any deck that tries to go under then can either push damage quicker or at least take out key pieces before critical mass is achieved. A Thoughtseize or removal spell (of which there are many cheap ones in the format) can tear you apart and set you back a turn or more in the early game, which is a death sentence. Elves Creatures 4x Allosaurus Shepherd 4x Dwynen&#39;s Elite 4x Elvish Archdruid 4x Elvish Clancaller 4x Elvish Visionary 4x Imperious Perfect 4x Llanowar Elves 3x llanowar Visionary 4x Paradise Druid Instants 4x Collected Company Lands 2x Castle Garenbrig 15x Forest 4x Hashep Oasis Elves function on a similar game plan to Merfolk; establish a dominating board presence thanks to a low average CMC and a plethora of lords. Where Elves rises above our fishy friends is in its mana generation. Llanowar Elves , Paradise Druid , and Llanowar Visionary all help your mana explode to deploy your hand at a blistering pace. Elvish Visionary keeps the train rolling, Dwynen’s Elite provides another body, and then there are three phenomenal lords: Elvish Clancaller , Imperious Perfect , and Elvish Archdruid , all with excellent secondary effects. Tying the Elven menace together is Collected Company which can turn your board from unimposing to a major threat in an instant (Editor’s note: …. Was that a pun? 3/10 at best). Elves have the explosivity that Merfolk lacks, and you can even adjust my list to include honorary elf Craterhoof Behemoth (searched up by Fierce Empath ) to really close games with a thunder of footfalls. Where Elves stumbles is when you draw all mana and no gas. A board full of Llanowar elves is nothing if you don’t have an Archdruid or Clancaller to beef them up. Also, of course, a well timed removal spell can turn an alpha strike into a slaughter of your forces. Goblins Creatures 4x Conspicuous Snoop 2x Gempalm Incinerator 4x Goblin Chieftain 4x Goblin Instigator 1x Goblin Ringleader 4x Goblin Warchief 4x Krenko, Mob Boss 4x Muxus, Goblin Grandee 4x Skirk Prospector 4x Wily Goblin Lands 3x Castle Embereth 2x Forgotten Cave 18x Mountain 2x Phyrexian Tower Lastly, we have Goblins, the best tribal deck, and potentially the only “combo deck” in the meta. Goblins only has one true lord, Goblin Chieftain , but their ability to give haste with either Chieftain or Goblin Ringleader more than makes up for that. Goblins can strike out of nowhere, which makes them a big threat. They also have healthy mana generation with Wily Goblin making a treasure, Chieftain reducing all your goblins, and Skirk Prospector being an absolute all-star when it comes to powering out our high end goblins, especially considering how wide Goblins can go (see Krenko, Mob Boss and Goblin Instigator ). Plus Goblins can keep up the card advantage with the new addition of Conspicuous Snoop and veterans Goblin Ringleader or Goblin Matron . But of course, we have to talk about Muxus, Goblin Grandee . Muxus is what puts this deck over the top and why I call it a combo deck. Often, the best thing to be doing is getting Muxus out there as quickly as possible, using Wily Goblin , Goblin Chieftain , and Skirk Prospector ’s insane mana generation (plus Phyrexian Tower at times). A turn three or four Muxus isn’t out of the question and can even be common. And depending on your luck with the trigger, you can easily end the game right there, or at least mortally wound your opponent giving them a single turn to deal with your army. As the deck I played the most, and my favorite during testing, I can say that this deck can live or die by variance. A Muxus flip of only one or two goblins can lose you the game and even if you get a veritable army, no haste can leave you vulnerable to Wrath of God which is running rampant in midrange and control decks. Also, with a six mana Muxus that you’re striving to get to, this deck runs a reasonable number of lands, but that can translate into flood if you get to a quick start and then get wrathed or dismantled which can stagnate and catch you an L. Overall, tribal decks are fun for their explosiveness and the potential to attack with a thick board of pumped up creatures. Also, the ability of all three of these decks (yes I even saw some goblins decks splashing) to play Collected Company is a boon. However, these decks generally lack the interaction to prevent an opponent’s game plan and are very weak to opposing interaction, especially in the early game when attempting to build a board state and a single stumble can crumble your whole plan. Aggro Decks Aggro decks is a wide label, which arguably includes tribal decks, but I’ve identified a few distinct archetypes that stood out: Rakdos Arcanist, Lurrus Auras, and everyone’s favorite… Burn! Lurrus Auras Companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den Creatures 4x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 3x Gingerbrute 4x Kor Spiritdancer 3x Ornithopter 3x Selfless Savior Enchantments 4x All that Glitters 3x Cartouche of Knowledge 3x Cartouche of Solidarity 4x Curious Obsession 4x Staggering Insight Instants 3x Karametra&#39;s Blessing Lands 4x Glacial Fortress 4x Hallowed Fountain 4x Island 8x Plains 2x Temple of Epiphany Lurrus Auras is an Azorius Bogles-esque deck. Boasting a ton of one mana or zero mana creatures (hello Ornithopter ) it can quickly suit up something harmless into an intergalactic menace (“Call Voltron to save us! Wait, our enemy is Voltron? Nooooooooo!”). By far the most important cards in the deck are the Curiosity effects, Curious Obsession and Staggering Insight . Being able to draw with every hit (this deck does not block, that’s for cowards) keeps the advantage snowballing. Stack up multiple of these on an Ornithopter or Gingerbrute and your opponent will be hard pressed to catch up. The cherry on top is Kor Spiritdancer . A veteran from Modern Bogles, she was introduced with Jumpstart and can get oppressively big while continuing to rip through your deck. Playing your final aura onto a Spiritdancer, drawing another aura, rinse and repeat until you run out of mana, is an easy and common line. This deck also plays Lurrus of the Dream-Den because why not, so of course it can grind and return any auras for a second run, just when your opponent thought they’d gotten rid of the pesky things. The weakness of this deck is you can get X-for-one’d if your opponent removes your Megazord, especially if they remove your creature out from under an aura on the stack. Alseid of Life’s Bounty and Karametra’s Blessing provide protection at key chokepoints, especially against decks heavy with removal or if you aren’t off to a blistering start (which can be common). The other weakness of this deck is of course going all in on a creature can make it hard to rebuild. Spiritdancer and the Curiosity effects are crucial for keeping a full grip so you can continue applying pressure. Burn Companion Jegantha, the Wellspring Creatures 4x Earthshaker Khenra 4x Ghitu Lavarunner 2x Grim Lavamancer 3x Rampaging Ferocidon 4x Soul-Scar Mage 4x Viashino Pyromancer Instants 4x Lightning Strike 4x Shock 4x Wizard&#39;s Lightning Sorceries 4x Light Up the Stage 1x Pillar of Flame 2x Skewer the Critics Lands 16x Mountain 4x Ramunap Ruins Burn has been a red mage’s ace in the hole since Lightning Bolt got printed, which if you aren’t an MTG history buff, was in the first dang set. Another deck imported from Modern, Historic Burn is a powerful and wildcard-inexpensive deck (Budget players rejoice!). Burn, like a lot of these decks, wasn’t a viable option until Amonkhet Remastered was released. Ghitu Lavarunner , Viashino Pyromancer , Shock , and Lightning Strike make a nice start for a deck with cheap threats and direct damage…but Earthshaker Khenra , Soul-Scar Mage , and Ramunap Ruins allow the deck to hum like a finely tuned, mach-speed, machine. Ramunap Ruins is just extra reach for the late game, but it can really allow you to push damage and be a little reckless with your attacks when you know you have four to six damage waiting on the field to close out an opponent. In a similar vein, Earthshaker Khenra also allows this deck to last a lot longer than normal mono-red decks. Khenra pushes damage early with its ETB and then when you’ve flooded out or have been slowly ground to a minimal board state, eternalize that bad boy and smash face out of nowhere. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition and no one expects a 4/4 in a burn. Lastly, Soul-Scar Mage functions as our Monastery Mentor with its 1/2 body for one mana and prowess. Its pseudo-wither ability is also far from negligible. With the amount of burn spells, most prominently Wizard’s Lightning (aka Lightning Bolt because most creatures in this deck are incidentally wizards), Soul-Scar can reliably be a 3/4 or 4/5 hitting unobstructed because you’ve removed any blockers. Burn’s greatest strength is its ability to get going fast, disrupt anything its opponent might be doing in terms of blocking and then close out with prowess buffs or direct damage. If you’re any kind of creature deck, especially one that focuses on small creatures, burn can run you over easily if you stumble, and sometimes even if you don’t. However, if you’re playing disruption like Thoughtseize and lots of removal or thick creatures, you can essentially brick wall burn. Also, any sort of deck that gains incidental or buckets of life can be an issue, as you might expect. Rakdos Arcanist Companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den Creatures 4x Dreadhorde Arcanist 4x Kroxa, Titan of Death&#39;s Hunger 4x Priest of Forgotten Gods 4x Stitcher&#39;s Supplier 3x Young Pyromancer Instants 4x Shock 3x Village Rites Sorceries 4x Claim//Fame 3x Claim the Firstborn 1x Innocent Blood 4x Thoughtseize Lands 4x Blood Crypt 4x Dragonskull Summit 6x Mountain 3x Phyrexian Tower 5x Swamp Finally, we have what I would argue is the best deck in the format right now: Rakdos Arcanist. Also lovingly called “Rakdos, You Can’t Have Any Fun” (at least by me), this deck is brutally fast and efficient at making sure you do everything and your opponent doesn’t do anything. If you can’t tell, I lost to this deck way too many times. I have the empty ice cream containers to prove it. The name refers to Dreadhorde Arcanist , which is the card that makes this deck so potent. It also hosts a bevy of cheap, powerful spells (I’m sensing a trend), such as Shock and Thoughtseize to stall and dismantle any early gameplan. Then when your Arcanist attacks, they can then get “flashed back” at instant speed. The graveyard can easily get filled by the playset of Stitcher’s Supplier which will happily chump block to continue to keep your yard stocked for Arcanists or to escape a Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger , another effect tool to deprive opponents of resources. And if your Arcanist bites the dust, Claim can get it back for a single mana! Or if your Arcanist is lonely, you can grab them a friend out of the yard! Fame , the back half of Claim can have your Arcanist getting an attack hastily, while boosting its power to increase the range of spells it can hit, if you’ve chosen to include something like Bedevil at three CMC. Young Pyromancer rounds this deck out and goes wide quickly with how many spells are getting cast per turn. To keep up card advantage, Village Rites often is included, which gets especially dirty when you can Claim the Firstborn to clear the way for your Arcanist and then immediately grave-cast a Rites. Similar to Burn, this deck can move incredibly fast and can disrupt anything an opponent does early to trip them up. Where it excels is its ability to accumulate mountains of card advantage with getting free second casts off of most of its spells and completely stripping its opponent of options through discard. Haste from Fame and “burn” from Kroxa gives just enough reach to finish off a player who thought they had stabilized the onslaught. Aggro decks are flourishing in Historic. Cheap, powerful spells have always been at a premium and this format is full of them. The clincher is that there is a mix of these that are threats, a la Earthshaker Khenra and Soul-Scar Mage and also answers, both reactive and proactive (things like Eliminate and Thoughtseize , respectively). The Story So Far… The name of the game in Historic is to go fast and be disruptive. If you’re a slow deck or if you have no way to disrupt your opponents gameplan, you aren’t going to succeed. Decks like Merfolk and Elves don’t hold a candle to Rakdos Arcanist which can not only go faster, but can stop them at every step of the game. Azorius Auras can thrive because it can protect its threat against this disruption or get big enough to shake off burn spells. Another key is not trading resources at an even rate with your opponent. Eternalizing an Earthshaker Khenra or flashing back a Thoughtseize with a Dreadhorde Arcanist is peak card advantage when resources have run dry. A single Curious Obsession on an Ornithopter turn one can draw three or more cards in a game. Started Blasting Gun GIF from Startedblasting GIFs Lastly, prioritize your best cards and what you need to get your gameplan moving. Each deck has a few key cards that are much more important than the rest, proactively and reactively. I think my biggest mistake while testing was not taking enough mulligans. The biggest example of this is in Goblins where cards like Skirk Prospector are key to generating the mana needed to cast Muxus, Goblin Grandee , which should be your Plan A, every single game. A mull to five with one of each of those is probably better than a full grip of seven with four average to good goblins. Next time we’ll test these tenants again as we look into midrange and control decks! What can these archetypes do to overcome the decks I’ve discussed here?

After a raucous romp with Syr Carah a while ago, I think it’s time to chill out a bit. I’ve come prepared this week, I’ve done my research, and I’ve even planned both decks before starting the article! &lt;em&gt;Cue applause&lt;/em&gt;. Thank you, thank you… but in all seriousness, let’s get right into it. This week we’ll be staying on &lt;em&gt;Eldraine&lt;/em&gt; and looking to &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link external-card-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/eld/326/chulane-teller-of-tales?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/8/3/83f43730-1c1f-4150-8771-d901c54bedc4.jpg?1571282906&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Chulane, Teller of Tales &lt;/a&gt; as our commander. By the way, did you know it’s pronounced ‘Hull-an’? Told you I did my prep work this time.&lt;/p&gt; Chulane was designed to support the soft reboot of the Brawl format and he certainly has the power to do so. His triggered ability helps you keep your hand full and your mana base growing, while his activated ability can help protect important creatures or repeat powerful enter the battlefield (ETB) effects. When looking at the casual list I realized I was putting a lot of creatures into the deck to maximize these ETBs. This made me curious… Do I have enough creatures and other permanents to build a Primal Surge deck? The answer is I can certainly try! Meanwhile, for the competitive deck I was able to find an incredible primer for the iCameo (an abbreviation of the deck’s wincons) build written by the user Joking101 that helped inspire this article. iCameo is an adaptive combo build that uses Chulane’s triggered ability to nearly deck itself then win through combat damage. If you want to cut straight to the cEDH portion of the article, click HERE . Otherwise, let’s jump right in with our casual Primal Surge deck. Joking101’s Primer casual build Chulane Surges In! This deck will run you right around $250. I think this deck is actually a great example of how I want my casual decks to play. They should have a solid game plan, multiple win conditions, and should feel cool to pilot. During testing for this, I felt like I nailed all those aspects. I think I was aided in no small part by the star of the show: Primal Surge . This card is not just powerful and cool, and to use it to its full advantage we have to succumb to one of the most stringent deck building restrictions this side of Companion: don’t include any other instants or sorceries in your deck. “Why would I ever do that Eric?” Well, I’ll tell you. This will allow us to dump every other card left in our deck straight into play. Then, we immediately go for the win with cards like Thassa’s Oracle or Laboratory Maniac provided any of our other creatures’ ETBs let us draw a card. (This is where cards like Mulldrifter and Mentor of the Meek can really shine.) The unfortunate thing about this game plan is that short of Ring of Three Wishes it’s pretty hard to tutor for Primal Surge . So, we may end up drawing some of our key creatures before we find it. In order to help assuage this potential issue, we’ve peppered in some other win cons that work well with Chulane and our current shell. Eldrazi Displacer and Deadeye Navigator to generate infinite mana with Peregrine Drake or Palinchron . If we have infinite mana with Palinchron in play we can cast Chulane, Teller of Tales , if he isn’t already on the field, then bounce and replay Palinchron until we draw any of Destiny Spinner , Helix Pinnacle , or Primal Surge . If either of your Lab Man effects are still in the deck then you can just keep drawing until you win (Remember to actually play the creature before you try to draw the final time… I mean, like you wouldn’t forget, you’re cool. I’m just warning everyone else). If those have been removed or are sitting in your hand, Destiny Spinner can make some pretty threatening lands. This is doubly effective if we just cast Primal Surge and have literally all our enchantments and all our lands in play. Alternatively we can pump all that mana straight into Helix Pinnacle and pass, hoping to win on our upkeep. It’s Dangerous to Go Alone So, take these protection spells with you! Having a five mana commander and a ten mana win condition is… bold, to say the least. We can’t just sit there hoping everyone will be nice and let our terrifying spells resolve. So, we have to find some creative ways to counter spells or delay our opponents without instants or sorceries. A few creatures are just counterspells, see Mystic Snake and Frilled Mystic , but they’re a little on the pricey end CMC-wise. Fortunately for us, they come with a body and if we have Chulane out they draw us a card and can even ramp us. Ashiok’s Erasure doesn’t have the benefits of being a creature, but is very effective at protecting us from common spells like Counterspell or Swords to Plowshares . If we are going for a power turn or trying to win, it may be worth it to look to Grand Abolisher as a more definitive way to deny interaction. We don’t always want to be quite so reactive though. Sometimes it’s much better to go and blow up people’s stuff before they start causing us problems. Caustic Caterpillar and Reclamation Sage both help us hate on artifacts and enchantments. We can even bounce Reclamation Sage with Chulane to get repeated benefit out of its effect. Terastodon can also help clean up noncreature permanents, but that still leaves us lacking in terms of ways to kill our opponent’s threatening or high value creatures. To resolve this problem we can run cards like Banishing Light and Journey to Nowhere . Calix, Destiny’s Hand can let us exile even more creatures under our enchantments. Repeatable removal tied to this ability is important for us given how limited removal can be without instants and sorceries.Some cards in a similar vein to this, but much better for targeting commanders are Song of the Dryads and Imprisoned in the Moon . These enchantments prevent our opponents from returning their commander to the zone. From here let’s move on to look at some of the more staple cards in our colors and how we can use Chulane to add some unique elements to our build. Rewriting a Classic Story Primal Surge doesn’t just limit our removal and control tools. Value generation and ramp often come from instants and sorceries, so we still need to find some cheeky workarounds in that category. The deck is full of low cost creatures, so we should be able to cycle through those pretty quickly given that each of them is a cantrip when Chulane is in play. Beast Whisperer lets us double up on drawing whenever we cast a creature and with cards like Abundance we can also maximize the value of each draw. Aid from the Cowl is another great enchantment for value maximization. As long as you’re using Chulane’s bounce ability, your deck is all permanents so it’s either a permanent into play or free ramp every turn. Coiling Oracle is a great card for us whether it’s acting as draw or ramp. But there are more consistent cards for ramping I’d like to look at. Wood Elves is an obvious one, it allows us to fetch forests, so we can even grab a few of the dual lands we managed to sneak into the budget. In a deck like this Springbloom Druid is Harrow on a stick and can put in some solid work for us with a few bounces. Avatar of Growth and Solemn Simulacrum both help keep the lands coming so that we can thin our deck and make sure we have all the right colors. Obviously we’re going to be running mana dorks, but I don’t think we need to discuss Elvish Mystic for the 100th time, no matter how much I want to. Once Upon a Time (Mulligan) Let’s make sure you get your tale off to a proper start with a good first hand. For our game plan if you have a hand that is even marginally keepable with Primal Surge , you should keep it. In most hands you’ll want to have a few lands and a few other pieces of ramp. We’ll be able to hit the gas pretty well once we get Chulane out onto the field, so keeping a hand full of pretty small creatures or mana dorks isn’t actually that hurtful. Chulane is a prime target for removal, so we should prioritize any hand that includes either protection or a secondary engine we can use to bait removal or keep things going if Chulane doesn’t work out. Removal is always nice to have, but we definitely want to get off the ground and get the ball rolling as quickly as we can. Drawing into interaction later can be better than sitting on it early, but that also depends on the speed of other decks at your table. In a more aggressive pod it can be worth it to keep a few pieces of interaction and wait to play Chulane until you can really get the engines going. The full decklist for this build can be found below. Full Decklist For now though, let’s continue on to Act II of our story, with the cEDH build of Chulane, Teller of Tales . For this list we will be going forward without any budget restrictions and strictly aiming to create the most powerful deck we can. Again, this list was inspired by the iCameo primer from the user Joking101. cEDH build What is this, a Marvel Movie? Chulane, Teller of Tales has such a ridiculously good triggered ability, that combos so easily, the competitive deck requires an acronym to understand the path to victory. iCameo represents the primary cards that allow us to reach the end state of our game plan. The cards in iCameo are Intruder Alarm , Cloudstone Curio , Aluren , Mana Breach , Earthcraft , and Overburden . These six cards represent our main path to victory. Our goal with these is to constantly bounce creatures that allow us to keep drawing and replaying the same cards. All of our combos start with casting Shrieking Drake , Whitemane Lion , or having Cloudstone Curio in play and casting one mana dork with another in play already. We’ll always target the creature we just played with the bounce, or the other dork for Curio lines, and have Chulane draw us a card and put a land into play. We can continue to pay for this process by profetting mana from tapping the creature before it’s bounced and untapping a land with Earthcraft . Alternatively Intruder Alarm and any mana dorks will have the same effects. From here we can repeat whatever sustainable loop we find ourselves in. We want to draw almost our entire deck, ideally put all our lands and enchantments into play and swing out with either Finale of Devastation or Destiny Spinner . Choose Your Own Adventure The key to an adaptive deck like this is to be well, adaptive. When piloting the deck we are constantly evaluating whether this is the time to be proactive or reactive. We have a lot of great mana ramp and acceleration like Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy and Priest of Titania that can help push us toward our game plan. But we also get to run cards like Mana Drain and Force of Will . The adaptability and game sense required to play this deck honestly is a big part of why I enjoy it. I even patched things up with the Azorius Senate just so that I could run Lavinia, Azorius Renegade . I think of her as our anti-Kinnan. She pumps the brakes for others in the same way he stomps on the gas for us. Much like Lavinia, Collector Ouphe and Drannith Magistrate are two great cards for a deck like ours, which is happy to spend resources to slow down the game and relies very little on artifacts. Any of your favorite hate bear style cards can easily slot into this deck if you find that these aren’t working well in your meta. What matters is that when you need to, you can slow other players down and bring the game to your tempo. Pumping the breaks and going slow is cool and all, but have you tried going really fast? It’s also pretty sick. With a five mana commander we can’t get too trigger happy and need to be very careful about when we play him, but in the right pod we can definitely fall into the most aggressive position drawing into one of our combos very early with the right start. We have the ramp to get our mana in place very quickly with the number of dorks we’re running. Once that is all setup, we can quickly find our winning cards with tutors like Enlightened Tutor , Sterling Grove or Trophy Mage . We can even find Whitemane Lion , Earthcraft , and Overburden by transmuting Muddle the Mixture . Once we have one of the enchantments or artifacts that we need, Ranger Captain of Eos , Recruiter of the Guard and Worldly Tutor can help us find the last pieces we need to close out the game.We run Crop Rotation just in case we don’t have the right lands or need Gaea’s Cradle in order to actually have a profitable loop. What Do We Say to the God of Death? Please take a seat for this next part, I have some unfortunate news for you all… the other players at the table are trying to kill us. I know, I know, it’s terrible. Take all the time you need to process. Due to the fact that we aren’t just trying to turbo out a win con, we are probably going to need to stop them from killing us before we can actually win. So, we’ll be running some ways to protect ourselves just in case. Angel’s Grace and Teferi’s Protection can save us in the case of a single burst of damage or some powerful targeted hate. Angel’s Grace can even save us from needing to use an early Pact of Negation . If we can see a power turn coming we don’t always have to be quite so reactive though. Silence is a great card that we can use to proactively shutdown someone’s turn before they even try to go off or we can use it to protect ourselves as we look to end the game. Even further in the proactive direction are cards like Rest in Peace or Linvala, Keeper of Silence which we can use to preemptively shut down some of our opponent’s win cons. Epilogue (Mulligan) Let us conclude the story of Chulane, Teller of Tales with a wrap on how to best start a game. Given that this deck has a high density of combos, tutors, and draw we can actually afford to be just a bit less choosy with our opening hands. We really need to start the game with a strong ramp opener though. That part of our game plan is pretty immovable. From there your mulligan diverges based on the other decks at the table. Often you might look around and feel like you’re playing one of the slower decks at the table. In that case, you should prioritize keeping control and stax pieces. You still need enough draw to get your own game plan into action down the line, but stopping others from snatching the game right away can often be key. I am fortunate enough to have some friends who believe that a fourway stax mirror is peak Magic, so we can also end up in the most “aggressive” position at the table in some scenarios. In those situations we should focus more on some of the protective cards I highlighted earlier. If we have the gas to win, we need to make sure those pesky control players and other player’s stax pieces don’t get in our way. The full deck list is linked below. I’ve included some other ways to win the game in the side board and have a full write up of each win condition in the primer. I’ll see you next time!

After multiple big shake-ups in Standard, I can sort of play base Simic decks with a reasonable conscience. So today I reunited with one of my favorite decks from the beginning of this year: Temur Adventures!&lt;/p&gt; After the disappointing performance of Naya Adventures last time, this deck really brings the heat.

After a week and a half spent driving across the country and getting acclimated to the constant sunshine and mellow temperatures of Southern California, I can once again spend countless hours inside with the blinds closed playing Arena. We’re back…&lt;/p&gt; …and with quite the spicy brew! This deck actually took me quite some time to tweak and get juuust right, but I have a feeling you’ll love the end product. For this fine installment of Enter the Guildhall we’ll be following Radha, Heart of Keld as she tears a path across Dominaria leading her army of lands to victory a la Blackblade Reforged . This iteration of Radha is a departure from her “mana dork” roots, but what an explosive pump ability! And it can be repeated!! Ooooookay, huddle in and let’s talk strategy. It shouldn’t be a surprise that this deck is going to be base-green. Considering the only thing kinda Red about Radha’s design is first strike (although I guess you could make an argument for massive pump being Gruul given things like Xenagos, God of Revels ), the bulk of Radha’s ability suite will come from playing lands of all shapes and sizes; very Green indeed. Once we have a decent manabase online it’ll be time to swing in with Radha and a collection of Gruul allstars. Since we’re in Green we’ll include Questing Beast , Aggressive Mammoth , Nissa, Who Shakes the World , etc. but Red won’t be outdone. Now, I don’t want to give too much away in the intro but ahem BOY I sure am TERRIFIED of these PEAKS. More on that below. After that comes some super secret Gruul sauce I’ve wanted to try out and a dash of removal to spice it up. Presto! One haymaker fresh out of the oven. Lands, Ho! Beanstalk Giant pulls double duty as both decent ramp and coming down as an absolute wrecking ball if we’ve been doing our ramp correctly. There are few more destructive forces we can have in the late game when our entire plan is to play all the lands. Azusa, Lost but Seeking is exactly the kind of help we need to move through our deck once Radha is on the field. Given that we can play lands off the top of our library, dropping any potential dead draws straight onto the battlefield is a pretty freaking strong upside. We’re also including Dryad of the Ilysian Grove for exactly the same reason. Solemn Simulacrum is… okay so it doesn’t really need a highlight. It’s Sad Robot. But at the same time SAD ROBOT MADE IT INTO BRAWL!!! Just like Cultivate , seeing EDH staples rubbing shoulders with our Brawl ruffians just hits the feels the right way, ya know? And when that’s not enough, we’ve got Arboreal Grazer , Migration Path , and Migratory Greathorn as well as plenty of dorks like Incubation Druid and Paradise Druid making one final tour before rotation in a month-ish…I’ll really miss these guys, but I have high hopes for Zendikar! Generals, Sir. Elder Gargaroth is this year’s Questing Beast and I for one am here for it. Swapping Haste and Deathtouch for Reach and Trample as well as just a ridiculous swath of abilities make the Elder a auto-include, for better or for worse. Nyxbloom Ancient is our best chance to get a multi-activation Radha going and while I never was able to put the two together I honestly might just keep playing this deck until I do. With a chance to be tripling the land benefit as well as all the other ridiculous stuff Green can do with three times the mana Nyxbloom’s troops will leave no opponent standing. Terror of the Peaks is proof that there’s actually red in this deck. Terror is a uhh “Terror” on its own, but given Green’s propensity to be playing big creatures it’s a match made in heaven to systematically wipe your opponent’s board. And their face. Gimme That Good Gruul If you’ve been into Brawl since it’s return in Eldraine you know just how ridiculously strong Green is. I can say quite honestly it’s second to none and any decks I’ve schemed up with Green in them generally rely on it to do the heavy lifting. That being said, it would be wrong to completely ignore Radha’s Red tilt. We saw Terror of the Peaks above but there are some powerful pieces that make the perfect complement to Green’s rampant board domination. Fires of Invention might be out of Standard’s good graces, but in a deck where lands are the name of the game? The synergies are priceless. More often than not I’d end up playing a beefy spell, followed by a ramp spell, each turn until mana became a concern of the past. Is this card a lil broken? Yes. Does it still feel good to drop a Cavalier of Thorns and an Aggressive Mammoth in a single turn? (And as Julian pointed out to me, it also leaves your mana open for activated abilities, Radha approves of this development.) Rhythm of the Wild is one of Gruul’s best support pieces against the ridiculous number of people in Brawl’s queue who have the audacity to counter my spells. In the playtests I did to prepare for this article, three of the five games I played with this particular build were up against decks that played at LEAST seven counterspells each. I’m not about that, and Rhythm saved my butt many a time making sure we could play our big ugly monsters (and get Radha on the board which is usually quite difficult) Fling …is all I have to say about that. The Results So…I’m not lying when I say this deck has had the best record I’ve ever recorded with an Enter The Guildhall deck. When I finally put this list together after countless versions and tweaks I went 5-0, but I will concede two of those victories were due in part to opponent misplays. In one against Tamiyo, Collector of Tales - my opponent tried to Voracious Greatshark my Elder Gargaroth when Rhythm of the Wild was on the field which… didn’t go how they were expecting. In another close game against Thryx, the Sudden Storm I swung for lethal with a Radha that had mutated with Migratory Greathorn on top meaning my Radha was now a four cmc 3/4 with all the rest of her abilities. This became quite important when my opponent activated their Blast Zone for three (Radha’s cmc) and was left wondering why it hadn’t worked. In short, always read your opponents cards - even if you think you know what they do. They still could surprise you. That’s not to say this isn’t a super strong deck, it is! Hitting someone for 21 is satisfying to such a core level my inner caveman was jumping up and down beating his chest. This deck does what Gruul does best. Smash.

Today, Hexdrinkers treads into new territory… &lt;em&gt;Historic&lt;/em&gt;! I’ve been hearing increasing murmurs of the format and its potential greatness. With my interest in &lt;em&gt;Standard&lt;/em&gt; waning for the time being, and the recent shakeups across many formats, I figured this was a perfect time for me to fully delve into the format in a new series: &lt;em&gt;Historically Speaking…&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; But as I was booting MTGA up, I realized, I have no clue what I’m doing. So, for my benefit and your entertainment, this article will detail the beginning of my foray into Historic; how it works, the card pool, the in and outs, I’ll present my full research on all of this as a baseline for moving forward. I’ll also discuss the meta a bit, though that is in flux at the moment. This article will mostly act as a sort of primer and then I hope to get into gameplay and deck techs later on. The Island of Misfit Toys Historic is a non-rotating format exclusive to MTG Arena. This means that unlike Standard cards will stay in the format forever unless they’re banned. The Historic pool includes any cards that have ever made their way to Arena. Dominaria, Ixalan as well as the more recent pick-and-choose remasters but we’ll get to those in a minute. Since Historic was designed as a digital format, it also allows Wizards to tweak it and try new things on a much larger scale and more consistently. This is a uniqueness that you can’t get in paper formats or ones that have long standing histories. Now you may be thinking that just means bannings and unbannings will be much more frequent, but there are other ways to shake up the format that are more interesting and arguably healthier than constant banlist adjustment. Old Toys = New Toys Historic, similar to the precedent set by Modern Masters last year, has its own unique sets that inject cards directly into the format bypassing Standard completely. These Historic Anthologies are small, curated batches of cards from across Magic’s vast history designed to fill gaps in the format. Adding answers to unchecked strategies, fan favorites from history, or support for new archetypes that need a boost, that’s what these products do for the format.. Powerhouses from days gone by like Mirari’s Wake , Modern staples like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben , and even kitchen table favorites like Serra Ascendant . These anthologies cover a broad spectrum of interesting play styles and eras to make Historic truly unique. So far, three of these anthologies have been released. Historic Anthology I in November of 2019 brought 20 new cards, Historic Anthology II in March of 2020 had an increased 25 cards, and in May of 2020, Historic Anthology 3 upped the package again to 27 new cards to play with. Each one (which granted a playset of each card included) was available for 3400 gems on Arena, or individual cards could be crafted using the wildcard system. Though these are no longer available as bundles like before, Wizards has said they hope to drop new cards into Historic every quarter, so we can almost certainly expect anthologies 4, 5, etc. to drop moving into next year with a similar amount of cards (or slightly increased) and with a similar “price point”. Though that isn’t the only way new cards get added into Historic. In December of 2019, Rhys, the Redeemed was added into both Brawl and Historic as part of the Brawlidays special event. Though nothing like this has happened since, it’s safe to say that we could receive singular (or much smaller than an anthology) drops as part of special events at really any time. The most recent and largest addition to the format comes in the form of Jumpstart, the supplemental summer set released a few weeks back. Jumpstart included a host of tasty reprints as well as a slew of new cards to assist each theme (and cater to eternal formats). Because of this and with its release on Arena, Jumpstart cards also were added into Historic (with a caveat). Exciting! Time-Out So we have dedicated, curated drops, special event inclusions, as well as supplemental sets that can get added. All of these avenues mean the Historic card pool is continually growing and cards that are new and exciting as well as helpful to the meta are constantly being shuffled in. But sometimes action needs to be taken to help balance the format. I’m of course talking about the traditional way of “fixing” formats… Bannings. Something that we’ve been all too familiar with over the past year. Historic has a banned list just like other formats (in fact, it looks quite similar to Standard’s, more on that later), but it also has a second form of disciplinary action: the Suspension. Another benefit of an all digital format is that instead of having to go through the ordeal of outright banning something, Wizards can suspend cards, essentially putting them in “time-out”. A suspended card is not legal in the format, but it only remains in that status for a short time (usually one to two months). During this time, the meta can readjust and Wizards can watch to see if the format becomes healthier or if other problems arise. After the allotted time, the card either moves from suspension to banning, or can be reintroduced into the card pool. Most cards so far have gotten banned after serving their time, but some cards have been returned to the format and it sets a nice precedent for the future. Being able to more quickly take action, test the effects of certain changes, and also not having the feel-bads or negative PR of a true ban, the suspension system is interesting and probably good for Historic and one of the benefits of an all digital format. As Above, So Below Lastly, let’s discuss the Historic meta briefly, so we know what we’re getting ourselves into. Given the power of the last year and a half of printings and also the so far limited card pool of the format, a lot of it looks similar to recent Standard. Up until the suspensions, Temur Reclamation was the top deck with variation on Bant and Sultai Ramp also doing well and variations of Sacrifice and Mono-red jockeying for position. In previous iterations of the format, Fires of Invention or Winota, Joiner of Forces decks were dominant. Field of the Dead builds, usually with Golos, Tireless Pilgrim have wavered in and out of the top of the format, with Field being one of the cards that was initially suspended and then un-suspended. After digesting several metagame breakdowns and deck techs, I feel I have a reasonable understanding of the Historic metagame. One of the characteristics setting it apart from Standard is the presence of several powerful aggressive decks (though the recent bannings have started to prompt a resurgence in Standard). Mono-red, similar to its Standard counterpart, is strong and recently a top-tier version of a Goblins deck has emerged thanks to the additions in Jumpstart and Muxus, Goblin Grandee . Mono-green and mono-black both can compete, and there’s even a mono-blue aggro/tempo deck with Curiosity similar to the Mythic Championship winning deck from last year. Gruul aggro with the powerhouses Questing Beast and Embercleave has been tier one for quite a while (though it just took a hit with the explosive Burning-tree Emissary getting suspended). History is Written by the Victors With the recent regicide of Wilderness Reclamation , I suspect that these tier two decks will quickly rise to fill the space. Also, Jumpstart cards are still fresh and haven’t been tested fully, so I hope they will start to make even more impacts and soon we’ll have a new set in Zendikar Rising to shake things up even more! I’m excited to explore this fresh new format! Next week I’ll be doing a deeper dive into the current decks and testing some of them out. After that it’s off to the Hexdrinkers special laboratory to concoct up some lists of our own! Hit us up in the comments or on social media for anything you want to see me build around, and remember to stay brewin’ y’all!!

As a commander, he represents a resilient threat that’s able to provide ungodly amounts of value over the course of a long game. In this edition of Plus 40, we’re going to take a look at what kinds of cards compliment him and his powerful end-of-turn triggered ability in a Brawl and EDH setting.&lt;/p&gt; Oh, and this is Oakley here by the way. Nice to meet you and thanks for tuning in. On Removal Removal in all forms is such a pivotal and emblematic part of running a deck helmed by Athreos, Shroud-Veiled . Lucky for us, his color identity comprises perhaps the two colors best known in Magic for their effectiveness in creature removal, black and white. Ideally, we want removal that only kills a single creature to be instant speed. Nothing groundbreaking here but instant speed removal serves the auxiliary purpose of giving us an extra target every turn cycle that’s been marked by a coin counter. This helps us set up for much larger turnarounds using our opponent’s creatures against them. One of the best ways I’ve found to utilize this is to kill an opponent’s creature after they’ve declared attackers but before blockers are declared. Then, once that creature returns under your control, use it to ambush block another creature attacking you. Another form of spot removal I’d like to discuss here isn’t instant speed but provides other forms of synergy with Athreos, and that would be “O-ring” type effects: As we’ve discussed here before, targeting someone’s commander in Brawl or EDH with one of these cards generally results in the commander being sent back to the command zone. Along these same lines, when a creature with a coin counter is hit by an O-ring spell, rather than being temporarily trapped by the enchantment the creatures are exiled and instantly return to your side. I had considered various “flicker” spells for similar reasons, but found them to be too useless when Athreos wasn’t on the battlefield. Moving on to larger forms of removal, boardwipes are some of the most value-centric spells in the game. With Athreos’ coin counters this power is turned up to eleven, giving a single wrath effect the power to twist an unfavorable board state into a crushing victory: Thanks once again to Athreos’ triggered ability affecting creatures that are exiled, the pool for boardwipe options broadens to include cards like Extinction Event and Cry of the Carnarium . I’m not exaggerating when I say that cards like these are so powerful in this deck that we want to run at least four if possible. In general I like to go with the ones that can hit the widest range of creatures but between the lower life totals and lower opponent count in Brawl compared to EDH one can easily justify running something like a Ritual of Soot too. The Landbase The most striking thing about this iteration of Athreos is perhaps his mana cost, which is now double that of his previous form. Hitting land drops for the first five to six turns is imperative in this deck, as our curve is going to be steep and a turn without playing a land could spell doom to an aggressive or midrange deck. Though it may seem excessive, I would recommend running 26-27 lands to diminish the chances of missing a land drop until after we’ve resolved Athreos at least once. Thankfully, our mana base is relatively simple in this two-color deck. The auto-includes should be obvious- anything in Standard that can tap for both black and white is fair game, including of course: We’ll be running a few “color-hungry” cards in this deck as well, so fetch lands like Fabled Passage and Evolving wilds are welcome. I’d argue that even Scoured Barrens and Orzhov Guildgate deserve a spot. The important thing is that we’re hitting a land every turn early on, not necessarily that every land we’re playing is coming in untapped. And while Castle Locthwain may be a worthy include for some much-needed card draw, I’d advise against running utility lands that can’t tap for any color of mana. Field of the Dead may be enough of a menace that you’d want to run Field of Ruin just in case but missing out on that colored mana can come back to haunt you when you’d least expect it. Rest assured, we have other means of dealing with hordes of creatures. Mana Accelerants We want to get our big spells out early in Brawl or some decks will be able to run us over before we can get the ball rolling. For this reason, ramp spells in the 2-4 mana range will be our target: The theme here is ramp spells that do things for us besides just add mana. This deck values a long game with its ability to recur creatures and spells that trade one-for-many. Solemn Simulacrum , already a format staple, ticks off every bonus box for us being a four mana creature that gets us to six mana the following turn in addition to having an ETB and a dies trigger, all qualities Atheros can take advantage of. Orzhov locket is a nice mana sink during long games thanks to our high land count and we need all the card draw we can get given the limited options we have to work with. Altar of the Pantheon is an enigma, at a glance it may seem like a perfect fit for the deck, but after playtesting I found that more often than not it was actually slightly less useful to have enough devotion for Athreos to be a creature. Despite being a great blocker, he becomes vulnerable to much more common forms of removal as a creature. This is not to say that having the extra devotion is a downside necessarily, but I wouldn’t consider it a plus either. Still, Altar only adds a single devotion and the lifegain afforded by it isn’t negligible against aggressive decks so it’s probably still worth the inclusion. Overall it would be more detrimental than anything for us to try and limit ourselves to using permanents with less mana symbols just to try and keep Athreos as an enchantment-only. Creatures and Finishers Creatures with strong ETB and/or dies triggers are going to be quintessential to our success with this deck. Mentioned before, Solemn Simulacrum is a paragon example of what we want to maximize the value of Athreos’ ability when our opponents are running few or low-value creatures. In general we’ll want to keep most of our creatures in the higher CMC range to maximize the value of the coin counters we end up putting on our own creatures. Being able to resolve a boardwipe before any of your creatures even hit the battlefield for the first time is also a great way to roll out the red carpet for them. The on-color Cavaliers both provide fantastic value when recurred multiple times, and Massacre Wurm/Girl are both creatures that will at least partially wipe the board every time they enter the battlefield, which is almost always good for this deck. This isn’t to say that you should discount creatures that aren’t as synergous as the above. There are plenty of creatures that are good enough on their own merits to be worth an include: This article was constructed deliberately to leave some slots in the deck up to the reader. Listed above are some of my favorites that I found when experimenting with the deck. The main similarities between them is that they’re all hefty, evasive creatures that can help us close out a game quickly once they’re in play. Bonus: “Gotchas” I wanted to take a minute to highlight some cards that definitely should NOT be put into this build despite seeming like possibly great additions at first: It truly is a shame how poorly Athreos and his pup synergize with each other. The flavor of Kunoros is great and all but he really doesn’t belong beside his master for the purposes of this deck. Having creatures unable to be recurred by Athreos because Kunoros won’t let them back out of the graveyard after they’ve died is not going to help us win any games. Heartless Act ticks many of the boxes that define a good removal spell but is unable to outright kill any creature with a coin counter on it, making it a terrible choice for this deck specifically. Lastly, Cling to Dust is a superb graveyard hate card but an undeniable part of its draw is its escape ability which we’ll be unlikely to ever activate due to how few cards will accumulate in our graveyard over the course of the game. If things are going well for us hardly any cards will be in our graveyard at all and if they are then Cling or any other escape card in black and white for that matter isn’t going to be the pivot that we need. Eternal Upgrades Athreos shows the potential to shine in Brawl, but what about EDH? Can his powerful synergies keep up with multiple opponents with more life each? Travelling back through older sets reveals to us plenty of cards that would go well with Athreos: Strionic Resonator allows us to double down on our coin counters every turn, giving us more great removal targets and more potential allies after a boardwipe. Ashen Rider proves itself to be an exemplar amongst the many new options we have for value creatures, exiling permanents of our choice both when it enters the battlefield and when it dies. Merciless Eviction , Wrath of God and Austere Command are only a few of many examples of stellar wrath effects sprinkled throughout Magic’s history that we’d want to acquire when upgrading to EDH. Efficient removal is something we don’t see as much in modern Magic as the focus of card creation has shifted from “answers” to “threats” over the years. We want to take advantage of the good answers printed in old sets, the prime examples of which are Swords to Plowshares and Path to Exile . One thing the black and white colors seem to lack in the current Standard is good unconditional card draw, but luckily we can supplement this weakness with cards like Phyrexian Arena and Read the Bones . Finally, Ashnod’s/Phyrexian Altar can allow us to cash out early on creatures we own to potentially get another “enters the battlefield” trigger as well as some much-needed mana to cast our larger spells. Disenchant and Crush Contraband are great cards that would be available for our Brawl build if desired, but where they really shine is in EDH where we have the potential to face much more oppressive artifacts and enchantments than those that exist in Standard. Smothering Tithe embodies exactly this type of oppressive card, it will be an auto-include in many of our opponents’ white EDH decks due to its extremely high ramp value when pitted against multiple foes. Definitely play a copy of your own if you’re able to get your hands on one. Deck(s)list There’s over 25 years of Magic cards to sift through when choosing how to upgrade your Athreos, Shroud-Veiled Brawl deck so try new things and see what works best for your meta! Here’s a full list I put together that I enjoyed playing a lot in one of my playgroups: Full Decklists Plus40 &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;God of Wrath (Brawl &amp; Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/plus40/2020/08/11/athreos_plus40.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;syr carah, and why bolt is playable in every format (commander)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/the%20top%20shelf/2020/08/09/TTS-Mono-Red.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/0/8/080a249a-df47-4769-bb63-0d8ab3f2467c.jpg?1583348244&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Syr Carah, and why bolt is playable in every format (Commander)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oof, what week is it? Why are my shoes gone? Is that a satyr chasing an animated brownie? I tell ya, they know how to party on Eldraine. Anyway, I was supposed to come here and interview one of the ‘Syrs’ for a TTS I think. I feel like I have some notes from when I arrived… Oh yeah! Here we go, &lt;i&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/eld/145/syr-carah-the-bold?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/0/8/080a249a-df47-4769-bb63-0d8ab3f2467c.jpg?1583348244&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Syr Carah, the Bold &lt;/a&gt; Notes:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; The rest of the page appears to be completely blank… So, I guess I’ll go find her to see if she has anything to share about how to build her decks. Mono red would certainly be a challenge… Her ability to exile cards whenever a player is damaged definitely makes more offensive strategies pay off. Generally the combat step is where your damage is done, especially in less competitive pods. For the first build, I would probably go with something like a budget voltron deck. Using Syr Carah’s ability to exile cards as pseudo draw whenever you land an attack, then pairing red’s love of artifacts with powerful equipment could have something going. In a more competitive vein we don’t want to rely on being able to get attacks off. In reality it would be much better to never even need to tap her, given her lack of haste. That has me leaning toward a storm deck, where we can use burn spells to exile a lot of cards at once. A lot of rituals could keep things moving in terms of mana, then you just burn out your opponents with some of the artifact storm cards. Alright, I guess we should start by heading off to see the lady of the hour! The Armory As always I think we’ll be starting with the budget version of the deck. This will run you under $250 and be a great jumping off point for any future voltron decks you want to build. I thought the easiest place to start would be with the damage machine herself, Syr Carah, the Bold , so I got pointed to Carah’s room in the castle. I figured I would find her there, and be done with this article in a hot minute. Turns out, she left. But I did find some cool stuff here that seems to indicate I was on the right track. Her room appears to effectively be just an armory. There’s an Assault Suit sitting in the corner. Passing your commander around the table like this can help stack on commander damage and may even discourage others from killing her. Who doesn’t want a turn to swing the big stick? Hammer of Nazahn is just kinda sitting under her pillow. I can’t imagine it being very comfortable, but I am happy to swerve all the equip costs given that we don’t have a ton of ramp in mono red. Also, there’s a Grafted Exoskeleton sitting in the corner. Which is pretty menacing given its power to oneshot people. In the corner is a box labeled “Do NOT Open”, but I think she wouldn’t care… Well, I’ll be! Looks like our girl was hiding a few swords from us in her secret stash. Sword of the Animist is a great choice. Ramp is always nice to have in a deck without green. Sword of Vengeance gives us trample, which is always good to help bust through token decks and chump blockers. I don’t get what was so special about all this though, there’s only room for one more sword in here and so far I’m not particularly impressed… Sword of Feast and Famine ! This woman realizes we’re on a budget here right? This thing is an absolute power house, but definitely can’t just get tossed around. This card can give you an instant win, so hold out on playing it if you can, but if you find the right way to use it, slam it and take the W. How does she even find the time to put on half this stuff in the middle of battle? Oh look, it’s a little Brass Squire . That thing has to be nice when you’re running a bit low on mana. It can also help snag a piece of equipment one of your underlings was just holding onto for you. Magnetic Theft can do the same, but has the added benefit of letting you borrow someone else’s equipment if you just so happen to be missing your copy of Swiftfoot Boots . It also looks like there was a Treasure Nabber in here earlier too. It dropped off three sol rings and a bunch of artifact ramp we can borrow for a turn. This will help us equip all this and play it out in a timely fashion. Anyway, let’s go back out and look for Syr Carah. Another One Well, her room turned out to be a bust. Let’s head out to the training grounds to take a look for her. I do see a lot of Embereth knights here, but not her. We’ll watch for a while to see if we can figure anything out about how she likes to scrap. Well, I can tell you some of these squires are getting a straight up Savage Beating . Either half of that card can turn a game around and if you entwine it, you’re in for quite the reward. In addition to all the bonus damage you get, Syr Carah, the Bold will flip you four cards off the top for the turn if she manages to hit a player with every attack. Oooh, that’s not even training anymore, that is just Aggravated Assault . When paired with Sword of Feast and Famine from earlier this can give you infinite combat steps, but even without, you can get a lot of value from repeatable extra combat steps. Hellkite Charger falls into a very similar niche both in terms of repeated use and infinite combats. Not quite as permanent, but World at War and Seize the Day do have the chance to get you multiple additional combat steps for the price of a single card. Even if Syr Carah isn’t here let’s take a look at some other soldiers we can include in the deck. Voltron decks are quite weak to targeted removal, so let’s look for some other creatures who can take charge while she waits in the wings. Inferno Titan benefits a lot from extra attack steps, which allow it to blow up some smaller creatures with it’s triggered ability or just beat face even harder. This is one creature we certainly wouldn’t mind lending that Grafted Exoskeleton out to. Plague Myr already has infect, so any of our regular buff equipment will suit it quite nicely. As an added bonus in the early game it can act as a nice mana dork. Like any Infect creature, you should wait to play it out to dodge any potential hate. Finally, Steel Hellkite does great work with all those extra combat step spells allowing us to destroy permanents controlled by all the players we hit this turn. This makes for some very efficient removal on an already scary creature. A Personal Punch This doesn’t quite feel like a Syr Carah deck yet though. Her ability to draw cards is very powerful in red, where actual draw is at a premium. Looking back on what I do remember from my week here, Syr Carah at one point just went off about Rain of Embers and Volcanic Spray , which was weird in the moment, but now I’m glad she talked about it. These let you potentially clear some dorks off the board and flip four more cards off the top to keep the turn going. Price of Progress falls into a similar vein, but can actually deal some serious damage to greedier players. Thankfully it will barely hurt us, if at all, given that we are a mono colored deck. However, we are hoping for most of our activations to come from attacking. In order to clear the way for these attacks, we can make use of cards like Disrupt Decorum and Mob Rule . If our opponents have large enough boards this may even allow us to end the game when combined with a strong swing from our commander. Retracing Our Steps Looking back through everything we’ve learned thus far, we aren’t any closer to actually finding Syr Carah, but we did pretty much reconstruct the first deck for her. The voltron shell is looking strong, so let’s run through your ideal opener then move on to our second deck. In this deck you are going to want to start with 3-5 mana sources in hand. At least two (probably three) of them should be lands. Given how much we are banking on Syr Carah for card advantage, it is going to be important to get her out ASAP. Once she is on the field we’re hoping to land some protection or powerful equipment on her right away. So keeping 1-2 pieces of equipment in your opener can be a great start. We would ideally like to round out our hand with one of our substitute beaters or a burn spell for once Syr Carah is on the field, but this last spot is pretty flexible and might change if you know you’re up against control or aggro mainly. Against aggro we would prefer some removal for their ramp or a way to turn their creatures against them. Against control we should be mulling reasonably hard for a way to ensure Carah can stay on the field for a bit once we play her (e.g. Pyroblast ). The full deck list is below. Onward, to the next deck! Full Decklist A Storm is Brewing This version of the deck is about as high powered as I could get it. On commander tier lists I have seen this commander listed in the same tier as Atla Palani, Nest Tender , our first Top Shelf subject. I feel like she may fall just slightly short, but don’t tell her I said anything. Not that anyone could find her right now to tell her. At this point we’ve searched her quarters, the training ground, and I’m running out of ideas. The last part of the castle left is the basement, so let’s take a look and see if I was right about building it as a storm deck for our more competitive option. Well, at a first glance I’m seeing an Aetherflux Reservoir and a Sentinel Tower . So I think we were right on with that guess. As we try to move through our deck with Syr Carah, the Bold ’s triggered ability, these will help us close out games and kill our opponents. Well, there are plenty of classic storm cards that we can include here, even without the use of blue or other traditional storm colors. Grapeshot is an actual storm card that has huge synergy with Syr Carah. Each of the individual copies will trigger her ability, exiling another card and allowing us to see more of our deck at once. Mizzix’s Mastery and Past in Flames will allow us to recur some of our more potent damage spells as well as the rituals we can use to fuel them. These should be saved for some massive turns where you think you might be able to kill a player or even wipe the table. Bonus Round is another card that should be saved for your all-in turns. However, it can be even more of a gamble as you’re often relying on lucky top decks or Carah exiles to keep you going after you start. This is the main weakness of the deck: sometimes you’re forced to go all-in because your opponents will win given another turn cycle. On Rituals and Reductions Now that I’m looking around more, there’s some sketchy stuff down here. Sure, the giant death machines and powerful spells are spooky, but the guy on Desperate Ritual is freaking me out, I mean just look at his face. It’s a great card for our deck though, so I guess he can stay. Casting this from our hand to ramp out our commander or just ripping it off the top to keep our storm count climbing is going to be worth looking at his mug though. Seething Song is just a grown up version of the ritual, giving us enough mana to cast Syr Carah by itself. There are also a few less traditional rituals we can run too, including Runaway Steam-Kin and Vessel of Volatility . These don’t immediately proffit you mana, but can be used to store up mana for big swing turns. Neheb, the Eternal can be the biggest ritual of all if we are able to land him before passing through combat. The damage we deal in the first half of our turn can all get refunded for hopefully an even bigger second half of the turn. These ritual effects will be great for keeping us going, but we can make that mana stretch a lot further if we reduce the cost of our spells. I’m sure I saw some cool looking artifacts sitting around down here. Ruby Medallion jumps to mind as an easy include. As a mono-red deck we’ll get a lot of mileage out of that one mana reduction. Cloud Key asks us to be a bit more picky about what we are reducing, but it shouldn’t be too hard of a choice. Given how key our commander is, creature is a totally viable choice, but once she’s down I would pretty much always pick instant or sorcery depending on what was in my hand. Helm of Awakening sits at the other end of the spectrum. We’ll reduce the cost on pretty much every card in our deck, but we’ll be doing the same for our opponents. We just have to hope we can capitalize off it better than they can, or that they’re dead by the time our turn is over. BURN BABY BURN You saw the article title, we’re all here for it. There’s Lightning Bolt ’s down here! It can be used as spot removal for a lot of high value creatures or it can be a free cantrip that lets us peek at another card while continuing our burn plan. Fiery Confluence and Skullcrack both have other potential utility, such as getting past damage prevention or clearing key creatures off the board, while still letting us cycle further through our deck. Molten Psyche is a great wheel effect (don’t worry we’ve got the OG Wheel of Fortune in here too) that also deals some pretty healthy damage to our opponents. Plus it highly discourages anyone who might want to play a Notion Thief . Speaking of burn versions of other spells, Mage’s Contest is a whacky counter spell, where you’ll pretty much always win the life bet. Nobody else is running burn spells (hopefully) and other decks are likely to play shocks and use their life total more freely than us. You can even try to push them to the limit of life betting, then back out and just use a Red Elemental Blast instead, you’ll deal a ton of damage and it’ll be hilarious. We don’t want to cast these spells just once though; two spells (like heads) are better than one. Reverberate targeting a Molten Psyche can deal an insane amount of damage, while reloading your hand or just juicing up your Past in Flames . Thankfully, a lot of copy spells are also part of some strong combos. I really enjoy the versatility of combo pieces that also help push your general gameplan forward. So, running Dualcaster Mage is a great way to copy more spells, but alongside Heat Shimmer and Twin Flame it can make infinite hasty 2/2 creatures. These creature copying spells don’t always have to go in the combo, we can use them to make copies of any of our other value generating creatures as well. Increasing Vengeance is another great example of this versatile type of combo. For this combo we need any burn spell, Increasing Vengeance in the yard, and any other copy spell. By casting the burn spell and copying it with Increasing Vengeance , then copying Vengeance we get two copies of Vengeance and two burn spells. We then recopy vengeance and recopy the burn spell and repeat until everyone is dead. Every card in this combo is useful outside of it, which makes it very easy to run. Don’t Mind Us (Please)! Alright, well Syr Carah wasn’t down in the basement either. I’ll finish this up with a mulligan guide then I really gotta figure out what happened last week. This deck, much like our previous one, is all about mana generation. We want to see Syr Carah levels of mana in our opener ideally, but at least 3 repeatable sources of mana could be good enough to hold. Do not, for example, keep an opening with Fire Diamond being your only source of colored mana and just hope to draw mountains. You will get your Fire Diamond destroyed by a trigger happy control player and be very sad. Trust me. After the mana, we’re looking to have a few good burn spells which we can use to start the cycle. The perfect hand would also have an artifact tutor or one of our big artifact payoffs for the storm. Well, here’s the deck list. As always I’ve tossed a few of the possible sideboard options in if you want to tech for your meta. I’ll have to update you with where I found Syr Carah next week… Oh my god, she was passed out in the Assault Suit in her room. And it seems like we got matching tattoos of the Eldraine crest. But there’s… like a third missing? I hope this bender didn’t involve any run-ins with the Ardenvale knights… Full Decklist The Top Shelf &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Syr Carah, and why bolt is playable in every format (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/the%20top%20shelf/2020/08/09/TTS-Mono-Red.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;8/3 huge banlist update&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/breaking%20news/2020/08/03/august03bans.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.magic.wizards.com/images/hero/2018_Daily_WOTC_icon_0.jpg&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;8/3 HUGE Banlist Update&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Breaking News&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKING NEWS&lt;/strong&gt; August 3rd, 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/august-8-2020-banned-and-restricted-announcement&quot;&gt;Banned and Restricted Announcment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Here’s what happened and my takes on the changes… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Standard: Wilderness Reclamation is banned. Teferi, Time Raveler is banned. Growth Spiral is banned. Cauldron Familiar is banned. Wilderness Reclamation has been essentially the defacto best deck in Standard since the last B&amp;R. Reaching above half of the field in tournaments and having been a dominant archetype since it was printed, its time has finally run out. Growth Spiral lies in a similar vein as ramp decks that run this (normally as a four-of) make uo nearly 70% of the metagame in recent tournaments. Ramp has become synonymous with Standard as of late and Growth Spiral is one of the biggest enablers. Axed. With Temur Reclamation as a deck now removed from the format, the other two dominant forces naturally will rise up. Rakdos (and to a lesser extent, Jund) sacrifice decks, which in all variations run some combination of cat/oven are quite resilient and lethal. Removing their go-to interaction is a good way to keep them from becoming dominant. Lastly, Teferi, Time Raveler has been a cause of restriction and frustration since its printing. It’s play patterns are repetitive and completely deny a lot of other strategies or cards from being played. It was the main force holding back Temur Rec from total domination, but with that now gone, there’s no reason for Teferi to stay in the format. Overall, I wish action had been taken sooner, but these are all good choices that strike at the heart of the issue as opposed to tip-toeing around it. I am sad that Cauldron Familiar is gone as I adore Jund Food (and Chev likes Rakdos Sac, that sadist), but they would have been too dominant with the other pillars removed and cat/oven is an annoying (and on Arena, time consuming) synergy. Historic: Teferi, Time Raveler is suspended. Wilderness Reclamation is suspended. Historic has recently been mirroring Standard. For similar reasons as above, Teferi and Reclamation are getting put in time-out like Agent of Treachery , Fires of Invention , etc. before them. Like above, I like this action, especially with no rotation in Historic to remove these cards from the format in another two months. I’m still confused with the purpose and effectiveness of the suspension list, but I would not be surprised if Teferi and Reclamation make their way to being fully banned soon enough. Brawl: Teferi, Time Raveler is banned. Once again, Teferi is just not fun to play against and locks playstyles or cards out of viability. Having constant access to him in a format like Brawl makes this threat omnipresent, and with him making up 10% of the field and having some of the highest win-rates, I have no qualms with him being removed from the format. Pioneer: Inverter of Truth is banned. Kethis, the Hidden Hand is banned. Walking Ballista is banned. Underworld Breach is banned. Pioneer has steadily moved toward Modern levels of degeneracy and this B&amp;R cuts the legs out from the main pillars of the format. Inverter (comboing with Thassa’s Oracle ) is similar to Splinter Twin of Modern’s past, a versatile control deck with an, “Oops, I win,” combo. It is the most popular deck in the format for this and its skill-rewarding play, but this has lead to its synonymy being scorned. Inverter of Truth as a key piece and also lacking redundancy (Thassa’s Oracle can be replaced with Jace, Wielder of Mysteries ) will remove the combo from the format, while preserving the shell it resides in. Underworld Breach is another incredibly powerful and popular deck in the format, foregoing versatility for blistering combo degeneracy. Once again, this deck promotes no interaction and is dagnerously fast. Cutting out it’s enabler, and generally broken namesake, will cripple the combo and make Pioneer ultimately a more healthy format. Kethis combo (oh look, another combo deck) is a small portion of the metagame, but it boasts ridiculous win-rates. Similar to Krark-Clan Ironworks in Modern, this deck is convoluted and extremely hard to pilot, but rewards skill and diligence with wins upon wins. Once again, no complaints from me by removing this swift and deadly combo from the format. Lastly, Walking Ballista fell upon Heliod’s sword. Heliod, Sun-Crowned plus Walking Ballista makes for an early and game-ending two-card combo (I’m sensing a theme here). These decks weren’t necessarily dominant, but they would be the most efficient once the pillars listed above were removed. Ballista can be run in any deck and its potential to be broken is much more varied than Heliod’s, so I can see why it took the fall. Overall, this is a huge mix-up for Pioneer, essentially crippling all the best decks. Once again, similar to Standard, I applaud hitting the issues at the root, there’s no reason for other cool cards to die for broken cards’ sin’s. Slowing down the format and removing the least interactive combos should bring back the players that have been hemmorhaging from the queues. I look forward to seeing how all the new metagames shake out and you can bet that we’ll be covering the brave new worlds emerging! Hit us up on social media and let us know what you think of these bans and what you’re excited to brew now! This is Julian, over and out.

The slang that allows the incredibly complex and growing rules set of MTG to function. Without keywords, we’d be a verbose mess and no one would be able to adequately convey anything about how the game is played or what actions they’re taking. But keywords, over the course of 27 years have grown to be a massive and overflowing bunch as nearly every set brings two or more new mechanics. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; But I don’t want to talk about Companion or Escape in today’s article. I want to throw it back to the most basic of keywords, the bread and butter of casual Magic that are known as ‘evergreen’ mechanics. These are the bread and butter of magic, as creatures were flying over to chip in for damage or trampling over each other long before anyone was counting cards in their graveyard for Undergrowth or tapping mana specifically to trigger Adamant. Today, spurred by the keyword-matters creatures and pseudo keyword lords from Ikoria, I want to focus on three of my favorite keywords: Trample, Menace, and Deathtouch. Let’s dive into a build focused on each of these mechanics with the added benefit that they all completely survive rotation this Fall! Math is for Blockers A great person once said these words, “Math is for blockers. Attack with everything.” That is the exact motto of a board full of creatures with trample. Our creatures are going to be bigger than our opponents, and no matter how they block, we’re going to decimate their forces and crash through for damage anyway. The centerpieces of this deck is the humble bond between a man and his dinosaur. Courtesy of Ikoria, Quartzwood Crasher and Proud Wildbonder . Proud Wildbonder, though taking away our ability to actually destroy creatures in combat, allows us to punch through damage rapidly and efficiently. And then with all that extra damage, Quartzwood Crasher triggers giving us more fat tramplers to block and then smash even more face next turn. But these two best buds want everyone to join in on the fun, which is why they’ve brought along a bunch of beefy friends to help them. Trample creatures generally are above rate so as to make use of the keyword and we have great includes all along our curve. Warden of the Chained is a great body for only three mana and since so many of our creatures are four or more power, he shouldn’t have any issues crashing in. His other 4/4 buddy is Gemrazer who can shut down small flyers or mutate onto pretty much any of our creatures to pick off opposing artifacts and enchantments. Stonecoil Serpent is great as it can fit at any spot in our curve, either as an early way to chip in damage, or as a big stallbreaker when the board gets cluttered. Topping our curve is Thorn Mammoth , a Brawl all-star who hasn’t seen any love in Standard during his tenure since Elraine dropped. Not only does the mammoth have impressive stats, but he comes in swinging and takes out opposing blockers everytime we play another creature. To help ramp into our trunked friend as well as our other creatures, we have Gilded Goose and Ilysian Caryatid , the latter of whom gets even better with our beefed stats. “Now Julian, you can’t possibility expect to solve all your problems just with Trample!” you might say. To which I would say, ”Nonsense!” Even our removal spells have trample! Ram Through and Flame Spill each punch the rest of their damage through to the opponent after removing a blocker or pesky utility creature and are welcome additions to this deck. Add in some Garruk’s Uprising s for card draw and Embercleave , cause it’s Embercleave and we’ve got one buff build! Tramp Stomp Artifacts 2x Embercleave Creatures 3x Gemrazer 2x Gilded Goose 4x Ilysian Caryatid 4x Proud Wildbonder 4x Quartzwood Crasher 3x Stonecoil Serpent 2x Thorn Mammoth 3x Warden of the Chained Enchantments 3x Garruk’s Uprising Instants 2x Flame Spill 4x Ram Through Lands 4x Fabled Passage 9x Forest 7x Mountain 4x Temple of Abandon Menacing the Witness Menace is the “newest” of the keywords we’re discussing today as Wizards has now made this the go-to specific blocking conditions after discarding Fear, Intimidate, etc. Menace is great because it makes our opponent essentially only able to block half of our creatures, makes chump blocking essentially impossible, and sometimes makes our board unblockable if we keep removing their creatures. The powerhouse duo in this build are Sonorous Howlbonder and Labyrinth Raptor ! These two make our creatures incredibly hard to block, let alone trade with favorably (or even unfavorably). Plus our Raptor’s ability will help manage their board from getting out of control and can pump up the creatures they didn’t have enough blockers for. Unlike the trample deck, our menace creatures are fast and low to the ground which helps us curve out and apply pressure quickly. A perfect example that also fuels further draws is Stormfist Crusader . Already a powerful card in Knights’ decks, it shines alongside our other mean muggers. Cavern Whisperer is on the bigger end of our curve, but helps strip our opponent of resources to keep up the onslaught. Grimdancer falls in the middle of the two and can play offense and gain us life or defense and hold back threats with deathtouch To help keep blockers to a minimum and to remove opposing haymakers, we’re running several removal spells. Fire Prophecy and Eliminate are both efficient and we’ve got Blood Curdle s for flavor. We’re also running two excellent creatures who double count as removal: Bonecrusher Giant and Murderous Rider . Though they don’t have menace, their value is undeniable and with Blood Curdle or Call of the Death-Dweller they can gain the buffs from our Howlbonder or Raptor. Call of the Death-Dweller is also key to get back either of our menace ‘lords’ that might have been removed. Mean Muggin’ Artifacts 2x Embercleave Creatures 4x Bonecrusher Giant 3x Grimdancer 4x Labyrinth Raptor 4x Murderous Rider 4x Sonorous Howlbonder 4x Stormfist Crusader Instants 2x Blood Curdle 2x Eliminate 3x Fire Prophecy Sorceries 3x Call of the Death-Dweller 2x Tentative Connection Lands 4x Fabled Passage 7x Mountain 8x Swamp 4x Temple of Malice The Kiss of Death Deathtouch is a rarely used keyword and is usually relegated to small, insignificant creatures (except The Gitrog Monster and Grave Titan ). Used to symbolize the small but deadly creatures that inhabit our own world, it’s primarily a defensive mechanic, great for stalling games with our opponent fearing losing their bomb to our deathtoucher that we’ll gladly make a trade for. On the flipside, deathtouchers can also make great attackers primarily because they are so small and our opponent won’t want to trade to block, that they’ll allow us to chip in turn after turn for a considerable amount of damage. It’s these two angles that we want to maximize in this all deathtoucher’s deck! There isn’t a ‘bonder’ from Ikoria to give a buff to our deathtouch creatures, but M21 gave us something arguably better in Hooded Blightfang . Now, every attack will drain our opponent for one. Add that to the damage from them most likely not blocking and we’re looking at a three or four lifepoint swing per creature! Add on the ability to merc planeswalkers and the Blightfang is a powerhouse. The other extremely notable card in this deck is…. Questing Beast . Yes, I know, we sold out. I don’t like this card either, but as a creature with deathtouch it’s too good to ignore. This will punch in a lot of damage for us and up our clock since most of our creatures are one or 2 power. Speaking of our other creatures, here’s a slew of our rank and file deathtouchers. Fetid Imp can cover the skies either offensively or defensively. Foulmire Knight provides card advantage and/or a cheap venomous body. Grim Dancer (remember them?) and Boot Nipper both are versatile in their uses. Thieves’ Guild Enforcer is new from M21 and provides a pseudo combat trick with its flash. Chevill, Bane of Monsters will provide us card advantage whenever we do need to trade off our creatures or if we use a Ram Through to remove anything pesky. Lastly, Call of the Death-Dweller and a singleton Nethroi, Apex of Death gives us grindability with a few Village Rites to churn through our library. Truly a dangerous deck to tangle with. A Gentle Caress of the Inner DIE Creatures 3x Boot Nipper 2x Chevill, Bane of Monsters 3x Fetid Imp 4x Foulmire Knight 3x Grimdancer 4x Hooded Blightfang 1x Nethroi, Apex of Death 4x Questing Beast Instants 4x Ram Through 3x Village Rites Sorceries 3x Call of the Death-Dweller Lands 4x Fabled Passage 6x Forest 8x Swamp 4x Temple of Malady Well that’s it for this week!

There’s a lot of things going on with our crew recently, including another new author to our team! He’s hoping to join me in the mighty world of Brawl so hopefully you’ll be hearing from him soon…in the meantime welcome to a brand new series!&lt;/p&gt; Plus40 For each Plus40 we’ll be highlighting a Brawl Commander and a powerful deck strategy while also including what additional 40 cards will make that deck a Commander allstar come rotation. It’s a way to hold on to your favorite strategies and cards past the Brawl expiration date, or as a way to just level up your game into a Commander meta. And considering it’s a set list of 40 cards, you can transform back anytime! Our first swing at this versatile new series comes all the way from Dominaria in Core Set 2021… Welcome to the Jungle Today we’ll be discussing everyone’s favorite Zhalfirin. GIVE IT UP FOR TEFER- Kidding. Instead, show some love for Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse ! Now, I know what you’re thinking and I was the exact same way. “Wait, a card that triggers off of card-draw … but it’s mono green. Chev. Buddy. This is a clear example of what should be in the 59 of someone with a more ‘blue’ persuasion.” And I can see the logic, BUT in this wild wild world we call standard Blue is not the only one drawing cards at ridiculous speeds. In fact, call me a heretic but between Guardian Project , Elder Gargaroth , Return of the Wildspeaker , and Keeper of Fables I would say Green might almost be drawing MORE cards than Blue….No one better tell Julian though, it’ll kill him EDITOR’S NOTE: Julian here. Smh, but it’s true. I’ll save y’all the rant. Basically what I’m saying is, there’s a chance we can build an entire two decks around green’s ability to draw cards and not even miss the islands a little bit. The Game Plan At her core Jolrael wants to be doing two things: making cats and buffing said cats with her mana sink ability. Drawing cards will have a positive effect on both since her buff is tied to cards in hand and will make our tokens. We’ll also include some extra go-wide synergy cards to sweeten the deal. That’s pretty much it! We want to be drawing cards, and we want to be loading up on as many Overrun variants as possible. Cats, Go These are all absolute powerhouses that I’m still not sure Green should have access to. Guardian Project is the most clear-cut draw engine for singleton formats considering we’ll never have more than one creature with a given name, and once it’s down, not only will each creature cast be generating tons of extra value, but Jolrael will be able to drop cats like nobody’s business. The Great Henge benefits us for casting creatures by drawing for each while also being an insanely powerful mana rock. Or more accurately a mana… tree… alien artifact. Lastly, Return of the Wildspeaker is an allstar giving us the option to draw a ton of cards OR as an overrun with our cat army. Either way it plays into our strengths to a tee. Rounding out this cast of characters is Elder Gargaroth , a pushed Green mythic from Core Set 2021 and Beast Whisperer who provides us a third back-up effect for casting creatures and drawing cards. Honestly Green, this is getting out of hand! Cats go Prrrr And what do we do once we’ve amassed so many cats we don’t know what to do with them? Well. We make them really big and we bap our opponent on the nose so violently they concede in a flurry of whiskers. Ideally, we’re using Jolrael’s ability to give everyone +x/+x on a hefty hand, but everyone needs backup. End-Raze Forerunners is like a little Craterhoof Behemoth but with more Boar, and a static +2/+2 with vigilance and trample for our creatures. Feline Sovereign is a cat anthem with a slightly relevant pro-dog clause, but also has a decent artifact or enchantment removal trigger. Overcome is a less mana-restrictive Overrun , but doesn’t provide quite as big a buff as the eternal staple. I’m also really interested to try out Klothys’s Design . While it doesn’t give trample, I feel like the average mono-green board state can put big numbers to our devotion count so I feel like the trade-off is worth giving a chance. Backup Squad At The Hexdrinkers Brawl Battalion we generally like to stay just competitive enough that we’re still able to come out positive, but not so competitive we’re ever restricted in our deckbuilding. That being said, it will always pay to have a suite of top-tier interaction and win-cons for when the going gets rough. Veil of Summer and Heroic Intervention are critical to protecting your creatures, and will give even the most savvy Dimir mages a run for their money. Nissa, Who Shakes the World is an excellent include from a mana perspective, a creatures perspective, and just a casual game-winning perspective. She doesn’t have much to do with cats but sometimes you just gotta beat someone with animated trees. Am I right, Ents? But wait! There’s more! Thaaaaat’s right everyone it’s time for the Commander build. Now, obviously there are cards that could be swapped out of our Brawl baby for a more intense final product but that’s not what this is about, son! We’re talking a straight Brawl DLC! This is like a season pass to all things Jolrael that can just be combined with your existing list for that little extra oomph! We’ll be sticking with the same themes: drawing more than once per turn and going wide, but adding the more powerful older siblings to a lot of our Brawl picks. Add a classic package of protection and removal to round things out. Talk less, Draw More Well, we won’t be causing any confusion about what we’re against or what we’re for, we’re FOR drawing a ridiculous number of cards. We’re AGAINST our opponents being able to do anything about it. The Archive is just absolutely insane. Now, a slightly cheaper draw-only version was just printed for blue ( Teferi’s Ageless Insight ), but feels like Blue can use all the help they can get these days so I ain’t complaining. You go Blue, you’ll get back on top one day. Now Alhammarret doesn’t really get us more cats…at least when used on your turn. It just lets you draw more cards. Get this activated on an opponent’s turn though and we’re seriously cooking. (That’s exactly why we’re packing Endless Atlas in this upgrade package.) Idol of Oblivion probably won’t help us generate any more cats (since it needs a token played that turn to activate), but I think nine turns out of ten it’ll net you an extra card which is still an amazing value for a two mana artifact. Lifecrafter’s Bestiary is essentially a second Guardian Project for a small mana investment, but also lets you scry every turn for whatever you need. (If you’re feeling like a little extra bling, sub this or Idol for Sylvan Library .) Going Bigger So we kind of hinted at this above but remember how End-Raze Forerunners is Something Something lite? WELL GUESS WHO’S HERE!! Boom. Game over. Hulk SMASH. {pics of Triumph of the Hordes, Thunderfoot Baloth, Finale of Devastation} Triumph of the Hordes is one of the more interesting Overrun variants, swapping a larger buff for infect. Even if your opponents groan a little, this is always a good way to end the game. Thunderfoot Baloth stands out in the fact the buff doesn’t actually go away until your commander does which could let you eek out a couple more turns of super buff cats. And then there’s Finale of Devastation . I….I don’t think I ever fully grasped what this card actually did but now that massive price tag makes sense. Not only is it a tutor that can search your graveyard for a game-winning piece but if you’re playing this late enough creatures will get +10/+10 and haste.. There’s a non-zero chance I’m going to be running out and getting a copy as soon as I finish this article. Jeez. Treat Yo Self. So far we’ve kind of stayed in the lanes designated by our Brawl build, but while Brawl is improved by the innovation required by a smaller card pool, Commander really shines due to the sheer volume of synergies available in lanes that haven’t been printed in a while. {pics of Doubling Season, Parallel Lives, Beastmaster Ascension} Doubling Season and Parallel Lives give us double the cats for double the fun, making up for the one-cat-per-turn limit on Jolrael’s army. Beastmaster Ascension has seen a lot of attention recently for just giving a permanent bump to all your creatures once you get it up there. There’s still a few more goodies in there that fit into the above categories or provide some extra flexibility but I’ll let you find them out for yourself, or let me know if I missed anything in the comments!

I would additionally discourage any of you from committing crimes such as mana cheating, ramping without a permit, or attempting to win a game against an Azorious deck. Here to help me speak to this is our honored guest of the week, &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/rna/189/lavinia-azorius-renegade?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/4/c497d496-1232-4614-93b0-9864fa93c29f.jpg?1584831655&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Lavinia, Azorius Renegade &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Lavinia’s high impact passive effect and low casting cost make her a threat right out of the gate. Regardless of the level your table typically plays at there are great options for Lavinia, which makes her perfect for this series. Our budget deck will be up first today, focusing on a combination between group hug and pillow fort strategies. With this we’re hoping to win a resource battle against the last player left. Until then we’ll be encouraging our opponents to bring each other down, while we slowly turtle up. The second deck today will be our high power deck and will focus on locking our opponents out with Omen Machine and Knowledge Pool . Then ends the game by exiling our opponent’s library, or just beating face. Hunker Down and Cuddle Up: As usual, the budget version of the deck should cost you under $200. I know the tapped out says it will be more, but it’s pricing Islands at $2.50. Don’t buy islands for that much, and please report anyone selling them to you at this rate to the Azorius Senate. Anyway, our plan will be to discourage our opponents from attacking us, while giving them the resources to kill each other. When asked for a quote about her commander style Lavinia, Azorius Renegade had the following to say: “I will personally stop those who seek to cheat or gain unfair advantages. I will root them out and crush them under the boot of justice! Their crimes-” Yeah, you get the point. With an attitude like that, we’ll want to see her on the field early and often to stop our opponents from pulling too far ahead of us. We aren’t stopping them from playing cards (yet), we just want to make sure they have all their paperwork in order first. We’ll end the game with cards like Approach of the Second Sun or Tidespout Tyrant . If the need arises we can even borrow some of our opponent’s cards to win the game a la Diluvian Primordial . But in order to get this far in the first place, we’re going to need to get the shields up and stay safe till we feel comfortable entering the fray. Our opponents are going to see Azorius and just immediately put us at target number one. It’s okay, they don’t understand the full glory of blue white. Anyway, when they start to get the lead out, it’s time to pillow up or shut up. Settle in for a Long One: The goal of the pillow fort strategy is to defend yourself by seeming like the worst target possible. If your opponents want to attack you, they’ll have to deal with cards like Propaganda and Ghostly Prison , as well as their big brother Sphere of Safety . If they want to mess with your game plan they’ll need to take it up with Tithe Taker and Unsettled Mariner . Another great defensive card, Illusionist’s Gambit emphasizes the Azorius Senate policy ”Don’t start nothin’, won’t be nothin’”. We can also more actively try to lockdown the game with some cards that pump the breaks on our opponents for whole turns. Lavinia of the Tenth slots into this category well and will allow us to stop opponents from attacking with any of their smaller creatures for a turn. This version of Lavinia’s Detain effect even prevents mana abilities from being activated. One turn lockdowns aren’t going to be enough though, let’s look at some continuous effects that really shut our opponents down. Fatespinner and Angelic Arbiter both force our opponents to decide if they want to cast spells or attack each turn and can be massively disruptive if played correctly. As a bonus if these somehow prevent other players from winning or making big tempo plays, the other folks at the table may even appreciate these cards (don’t count on it though). Lockdown doesn’t always send a strong enough message though, sometimes we need destruction. Karmic Justice answers this call perfectly and reassures our opponents that the Azorius Senate knows how to smash just as well as Gruul, we just have more restraint. Eventually, things will inevitably get out of hand with one of our opponents, so we’ll need to be able to reset them to a position where our taxes and fees will keep us safe. Terminus and Single Combat can help us clear off the board without completely losing everything. Either everything ends up back in people’s decks, ours included, or we get to keep a key creature, like Lavinia, on the board. Tragic Arrogance is a great card to sub in if either of these don’t fit your style. Not every problem requires the nuclear option though, sometimes we can pinpoint a key permanent that is offsetting the balance of things. For that, targeted removal will be our best friend. Winds of Abandon is a great middle ground here, allowing us to either shut it all down, or nail a key target. For our dedicated single target removal, we still like that idea of keeping the balance. Generous Gift lets someone keep a blocker, but can remove any permanent that we believe is problematic for us. Fractured Identity leans in the other direction. If someone pulls out way ahead by dropping a game ending creature, just teach them that sharing is caring and spread that wealth around the table. One last card I want to highlight is Oblation which is still great removal, but also hints toward the other archetype we’re mixing into this deck, Group Hug. EDH Politics 101: Group hug is another strategy that tries to push the aggression off of you. But this time it does so by giving the other players resources and playing symmetrical effects. You can usually negotiate your way out of any early aggression using these effects. Later, you might be able to exchange some of that goodwill for help on cards like Fact or Fiction and Truth or Tale . If you really trust another player, you could even pull off a big Epiphany at the Drownyard . Some great creatures that fit into this game plan are Kami of the Crescent Moon , Orzhov Advokist , and even Jace’s Archivist . These cards initially appear weak because you’re spending a card, but everyone gets the same benefit as you. The key here comes with finding ways to break this parity. For Jace’s Archivist this can come from causing your opponent’s to discard key cards while giving you a free reload. While with Kami of the Crescent Moon we are hoping to spend less cards getting to the late game than our opponents, so we’ll be profiting more from each draw. There are a lot of different ways to manipulate or control the group’s opinion of you. You can play cards that buff their creatures specifically but ensure you aren’t at risk, like Martial Impetus or Vow of Flight . Alternatively you can let them decide how your cards play out, even though it usually just does what you wanted, using Will of the council cards. Two perfect examples of this are Split Decision and Council’s Judgment . Sometimes you just want to give out resources to remind people you’re everyone’s best friend. Minds Aglow , Otherworld Atlas , and Temple Bell will help you keep people’s hands full and keep them happy with you. It doesn’t hurt to ensure that your Recurring Insight will always net you a full hand either. At its heart this is still a control deck that will take some good thinking to pilot well. So, make sure to keep an eye on players’ resources and know when to be giving out handouts versus when to lay down the law. Starting Your Political Career: This is a new section I’ll be adding to each of these articles, where I give a brief rundown on how to identify a good starting hand and how to make use of it. For this deck we don’t really have any ramp outside of a few artifacts and our average CMC is a bit high. So, we’ll be looking for three to four mana sources in our starting hand. This will ensure that even if we don’t see lands for a little while we can keep playing on curve. After that, make sure that you have one or two cards that can help keep you safe in the short term. These could come from the Pillow Fort or the Group Hug category, we just want a way to put the shields up early. After that we will be looking for either draw or a long term plan. If we can find a consistent draw engine we’ll be well stocked with resources into the midgame. If we have one of our win cons or another high value spell we can try to politic our way into making that as high impact as possible. Take a look below for the full decklist with a small sideboard of other cards you may want to include. Full Decklist The True Glory of Azorius Now that I’ve served half my sentence.. Uh I mean, now that I’m halfway done with my volunteer work, onto the second deck of this article! This second deck isn’t meant to lock down the first time mana-cheating offenders, this deck is meant to lay down the law against the serious rule breakers. We won’t be doing any hugging and there certainly won’t be any pillows, this is going to be full blown Lavinia, Azorius Renegade cruel control with a lockout win condition. Based on her effect, if we land Omen Machine or Knowledge Pool and have Lavinia on the board we will either prevent our opponents from ever casting another spell or prevent them from ever drawing another card. This is a relatively hard lock, but can still be picked if we don’t have some counter magic or removal ready for a few of the cheeky work arounds. Once we have our opponents shut out we can clean up the table in a few different ways if our opponents don’t concede. Jace, the Mind Sculptor should be able to safely get off his ultimate at this point, which will easily secure us the win as we go around the table removing everyone from the game. Helm of Obedience and Rest in Peace will allow us to do the same thing, again one player at a time. As a bonus, Rest in Peace is just a good stax card that we can play out as we feel necessary. Finally, we could always just slowly beat them to death with our creatures, regardless of how small they may be. Throw the Book at Them: Given that we are trying to win the game by playing our commander, a six mana artifact, and we want to keep some mana open for counter magic, we will not be the quickest deck at the table. So, we need to control the flow of the game until then. Mana Breach , Damping Sphere , and Winter Orb should help us prevent our opponents from ramping too hard or getting out in front of us from a resource perspective. Juntu Stakes will also help us keep our opponents mana dorks down without hurting our game plan. We’ll be running some cool planeswalkers to help keep our opponents from winning as well. Gideon of the Trials literally says that they can’t win the game while he or another beefcake is around. This is perfect for stopping a Thassa’s Oracle or Laboratory Maniac win. On top of these other cards, Narset, Parter of Veils and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria can do a lot to slow down our opponents. We also have plenty of creatures that we can use to help lock down our opponents. Alms Collector offers you a slightly worse Notion Thief without needing access to black mana. Card draw in white is hard to come by, so I’m always happy to borrow some from the other players at the table. Drannith Magistrate is a relatively new card that will do great work for us. It works similar to our commander for either of our locks, or can function as an early stax piece. Linvala, Keeper of Silence and Hushbringer both help us lock out creature abilities and win conditions, which can be very important depending on the metagame at your table. Finally, Nimble Obstructionist is an uncounterable Stifle that draws us a card. As a control deck, we are obviously going to be running a healthy amount of counterspells and removal. Baral, Chief of Compliance will help us get these spells out and reward us for successfully countering any of our opponent’s nasty ideas. Fierce Guardianship will help us prevent anyone from messing up the lock, ideally for free if Lavinia is already on the board. Pact of Negation won’t punish us too badly because in theory we are free to waste five mana the turn after our lockdown goes into place. Delay and Ertai’s Meddling allow us to delay a spell, then counter it with Lavinia, Azorius Renegade or Drannith Magistrate . Chain of Vapor will help encourage our opponents to hurt each other and themselves while still being functional removal. Even if this gets turned back on us, we’ll end up getting more benefit out of it because we suffer less when removing our lands. Speaking of removing lands, Armageddon and Cataclysm will both make appearances in this deck. You may wonder if I’m running Ravages of War ; I’m not. In my opinion there are good ways to spend $150 improving your deck and bad ways to do it. Including that card over another one of our spells wouldn’t dramatically change our win rate and could even reduce it depending on the meta. It’s not worth it. The Keys to the Kingdom: The final element of this deck I want to highlight is the cards that help us in the resource battle. As a control deck we are often trading down, going one for one with different opponents. Our stax pieces will help slow down the other players at the table, but that’s still not enough. Smothering Tithe and Land Tax will help us stay in the game from a mana perspective. As other players ramp or draw, we will naturally generate resources off their cards. Shoutout to Tithe which can also help snag us some lands. Rhystic Study and Mystic Remora fall into the same category, but instead help us keep our hand full of spells that can impact the game. Mangara the Diplomat also keeps our hand full, but instead comes on a reasonable body for a similar cost. Windfall can also be used to reset our hand after we’re low on resources and cause our opponents to discard some of their high value cards. This move is particularly effective if anyone else at the table has been tutoring a lot or you suspect they may go for the win next turn. Speaking of tutors, we can’t just rely on draw to find our lock cards. Treasure Mage happens to hit both Omen Machine and Knowledge Pool , which works perfectly for us. Enlightened Tutor is a classic for strategies like ours. As a nice cherry on top it also works as a way to find key stax pieces or other important cards before we’re ready to win. Mystical Tutor can’t grab either of our artifacts, but can hit any of our other tutors as well as removal or counter magic. Finally, Whir of Invention works very well with all the artifacts we’re running and allows us to tutor either of our lock cards straight to the field. I AM THE SENATE: In this version of the deck we have a lower CMC and a lot of artifact ramp. I would still look for three mana sources or fetch lands, but place a stronger emphasis on having some amount of artifact ramp in the hand. Once you’re comfortable with that, we need to have some early counter magic. Other players are going to start looking for the win as soon as their first turn, so we need to be ready to stop them. In the same vein we’ll need one or two of our early stax pieces to deny our opponents the ability to look for that early win. Finally, resource generation is still important. Once we’ve blown through our opening hand, which will be very fast, we need to be able to reload and keep up the pressure. In conclusion, you’re priorities in order are: The full deck list is given below. Well, now that I am done with my volunteer work I think I’m gonna hop off this plane for a bit. Maybe take a tour of Eldraine. I heard Syr something or other was hosting a party and those are always a fun time. See you next week! Full Decklist The Top Shelf &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;No More Ms. Nice Azorius (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/the%20top%20shelf/2020/07/23/TTS-Azorius.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;on the hunt for combos (commander)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/the%20top%20shelf/2020/07/16/TTS-WhaleWolf.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/c/4/c44cfa67-6276-4d23-9f25-a0576bfe1d25.jpg?1591234307&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;On the Hunt for Combos (Commander)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome back to another article in &lt;em&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/em&gt; series. This week we will be dipping back into the well of commander precons. &lt;em&gt;C20&lt;/em&gt; featured the return of &lt;em&gt;Partners with&lt;/em&gt;, a mechanic I found very interesting and was happy to see again. I think that &lt;em&gt;Partners with&lt;/em&gt; outshines the original &lt;em&gt;Partners&lt;/em&gt; mechanic because it allows the design team to build in bespoke synergies or game plans with a lower risk of accidentally creating something overpowered. In an effort to branch out from my comfort colors of Naya, I’ll be looking at a Sultai deck this week! (I won’t give up green, you can’t make me. I have rights!)&lt;/p&gt; Cazur, Ruthless Stalker and Ukkima, Stalking Shadow are great partners, where the synergy immediately jumps out at you. Swing in with Ukkima to get buffs from Cazur and quickly snowball into a commander damage win or burn for a bunch when your whale wolf leaves the battlefield. In this article we will be exploring a build that falls into this high synergy, partner focused, category and a very interesting competitive take utilizing Food Chain combos. The Power to Bite Let’s jump into our budget list first. The deck should run you under $200 and offer a well-tuned gameplan. It will focus on beefing up Ukkima, Stalking Shadow to land powerful hits and to punish our opponents for removing him. We want Ukkima’s growth to be permanent, so we are going to be focusing mainly on +1/+1 counters as opposed to combat tricks and temporary buffs. When building this deck, my mind immediately jumped to cards like Hardened Scales , Winding Constrictor , and Corpsejack Menace . These cards will give us significant incremental growth to bolster the counters we are already building up on Ukkima. Strategies that rely on counters always love Proliferate, so we can toss in Thrummingbird and Inexorable Tide as well. Finally, I always find it helpful to sometimes just win the game, so let’s have Simic Ascendancy as our cherry on top. There are a few all-star cards when it comes to +1/+1 counters we get to include that I’m very excited about. Reyhan, Last of the Abzan is great at saving the counters from our dying creatures and getting them back on Ukkima where they belong. Forgotten Ancient also does a great job of sharing the wealth of +1/+1 counters, eventually funneling them onto our favorite Whale Wolf. Vorel of the Hull Clade and Hydra’s Growth let us stomp on the gas and kill our opponents much faster by just doubling the counters on Ukkima. Speaking of killing our opponents quickly… Don’t tell anyone I told you, but Tainted Strike is super gross in this deck and you should absolutely run it. I can’t say it’ll win you friends but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t win games. Now that Ukkima is big, we’ve painted a target on our backs. People will try to lock him down but may be careful about killing him for fear of the damage he’ll do when he dies. I expect to see a fair amount of hate aimed at us as soon as Ukkima’s any larger than 6/6. We can always try to prevent his destruction, but then we have to go through the whole rigmarole that is the commander tax and dodging counterspells. Instead let’s just swerve that and blink that boi! Displace and Ghostly Flicker are spells that will help us save Ukkima and Cazur from any targeted removal. Evacuation and Flood of Tears act as the nuclear option, allowing us to fully reset the board, sometimes we even get to put Ukkima or another key creature right back into play. Under the Sea: Darlin blue’s better, down where it’s wetter, take it from me! Let’s talk draw. In our last Top Shelf article we were relying on green to move through our deck… Spoiler: that’s not very good. In this deck we’ll still be looking to green for cards like Greater Good to help with drawing cards, but now that we have blue and black a lot of new doors are open to us. Cold-Eyed Selkie and Edric, Spymaster of Trest will work very well with Cazur, Ruthless Stalker , allowing us to get more benefits from our attacks and draw some cards. Mystic Remora , also known as THE FISH, will be a great draw tool for us. You’ll never get tired of interrupting your friends with “You gonna pay four for that?” (Another spoiler: they probably won’t be paying four) Of One Mind and Treasure Cruise let you draw multiple cards for one mana in a lot of situations, which is really gonna help us find our powerful cards. Finally, shoutout to Tezzeret’s Gambit for being a totally fine draw spell that also gives us more proliferate. Read the Bones is a classic example of Black’s style of draw, turning in some small portion of your life for resources. Sign in Blood and Night’s Whisper are both similar draw options, so we’ll be running both of those as well. When we combine black with blue we get some unique draw adjacent effects. Fallen Shinobi and Mythos of Brokkos are great examples of resource generation that don’t necessarily fit into the category of draw. Now that we can move through our deck even faster, we want a lot of mana to play as many of these awesome cards as quickly as possible. There’s not a ton of unique ramp in here so I’ll keep this quick. We’re gonna run a standard set of mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic as a baseline. Then drop in a nice mix of ramp sorceries. Migration Path is a nice new ramp spell, but who could forget the classics such as Kodama’s Reach and Cultivate . We’ll put all of ‘em in just to be safe. Spells like this are actually going to work really well with Evolution Sage to keep those counters growing. Hunting Tactics: So, we have our battle plan and our pack (pod? pock? We’ll stick with pack) behind us. Now let’s start circling in for the kill. Blue and black are going to give us the ability to easily disrupt our opponent’s game plan as we are working on our own. Counterspell is the OG, but Arcane Denial is a personal favorite. Conditional counterspells and removal are often a great include. It’s pretty easy to find options where either the condition is easy to manipulate or accidentally achieve. Drown in the Loch is a great card in this category. Finally, cards like Putrefy and Beast Within will help us clear out any final permanents stopping Ukkima from going in for the kill. That’s the full story for our first deck. As usual I’ve included some options that you may want to toss in from the maybe board depending on your preference or meta. Take a look at the full list below and let’s head onto our next deck! Full Decklist In R’lyeh We Wait Dreaming Now, the competitive version of this deck is much better known than the Atla Palani, Nest Tender deck from last week, but I’m still excited to give my take on it. As I mentioned earlier, we’re going to be mainly looking for a Food Chain combo to win the game. Eternal Scourge and Misthollow Griffin are both able to be cast from exile after they’re banished to the shadow realm via Food Chain . This will allow us to generate one additional colored mana (which can only be spent on creatures) each time we go through the loop. Repeat said loop an infinite amount of times and Boom! infinite mana! This will allow us to repeatedly cast, Ukkima, Stalking Shadow , who when exiled or returned to the command zone is able to damage equal to his power. So we’ll be looking to end most games by spending our infinite mana casting and exiling him over and over again, wiping the table. I personally do not like Thassa’s Oracle . I think Demonic Consultation and Tainted Pact wins with this card are far too generic and easy to pull off in any UBX shell, BUT! This is one of those UBX shells, so we’ll be running them and I’ll find another time or article to offer my full opinion on this. Jace, Wielder of Mysteries will act as a nice backup to the Oracle. If you happen to feel the same as me, it’s actually really easy to swap out these four cards with Deadeye Navigator , Peregrine Drake , and Palinchron . This also eliminates the need for a singleton manabase, which can help cut down on deck cost. In this version we just create infinite mana then blink Ukkima for the win, instead of exiling him with Food Chain . On the Hunt… For Our Combo Now that we know how to win with this version of the deck, let’s sniff out those combo pieces. Standard black and blue draw are going to help us build a solid foundation to find the cards we’re looking for. Necropotence and Notion Thief will be able to hopefully allow us to draw a lot of cards at once. While we’ll be running some of the more ubiquitous draw spells, like Ponder , Brainstorm , and other cantrips, we get to run some very weird cards that border on being tutors because we are a Food Chain deck. Foresight and Manipulate Fate let us pre-exile either Eternal Scourge or Misthollow Griffin . Extract will also enable our Food Chain combos, but can be used to remove key combo pieces from your opponent’s decks if it comes to it. There are more cards that ride this line between tutoring and drawing cards. Lim-Dul’s Vault and Plunge Into Darkness will allow us to seek specific combo pieces or key cards we need in a moment. These cards are very powerful, but if you play in a meta where chip damage and life total is relevant they should probably be used as a last resort to either lock in your win or stop someone else’s. Almost all of our tutors will be split between those that only find creatures and those that can help us find anything we’d like. Worldly Tutor and Neoform will help us find our creature based win-conditions, but generic tutors can help find those as well. Grim Tutor , Demonic Tutor , and Vampiric Tutor are all going to be awesome for us. We can hunt down any card we need pretty cheaply and efficiently. Cazur is Still Here… Kinda Unlike the more casual version of the deck, Cazur is probably not going to be in play much. He does offer his friend Ukkima certain benefits though, if you know what I mean… Yeah, I’m talking about green ramp. We’ll be stuffing our deck to the gills with mana dorks and other spells to speed up our curve. Bloom Tender and Arbor Elf are often great choices for multi colored decks, as they can generate multiple mana and/or multiple colors of mana. Wall of Roots and Elvish Spirit Guide are great for generating mana quickly and immediately if the need arises. Alternatively, Deathrite Shaman exile key cards from our opponents’ graveyards, potentially even saving a game, when we aren’t using it for mana. For non-creature based mana sources, Carpet of Flowers is still just as good as it was last week. The list of mana artifacts we’ll be running is the same as last week. I’ll be looking more into cool artifacts and artifact focused decks in the future, but for right now I’m not a big enough expert to make any hot takes. To be clear, Cazur isn’t just in the deck to activate our ramp cards. He also turns on some of our powerful interaction spells. Abrupt Decay and Assassin’s Trophy are great removal tools in the deck, that Cazur can brag wouldn’t be around if it weren’t for him. We can also enjoy tilting our friends who play standard with Veil of Summer and it’s slightly less cool cousin Autumn’s Veil . As nice as it is that Cazur is here to hang out, let’s just have another round of applause for Ukkima allowing us to run the powerful counterspells and tech cards in UB. Your Opponents Trying to Win? Just Say No. Counterspells are one of the most powerful tools in magic. “Counter target spell” is up there for the three best words to put on a card. So let’s take a look at some of the best counterspells for the format, the ones you don’t even have to spend mana on! Force of Negation is unbelievably powerful, while hitting the wallet a bit more gently than Force of Will . If you have both, I would absolutely suggest running them in tandem but I’ll be sticking with Negation. Speaking of negation, Pact of Negation is great for winning the game, when there won’t be a next turn. Narset’s Reversal can also help lock in a win by potentially stealing your opponent’s tutor or game winning spell. Even just a slight tax from cards like Miscast , Spell Pierce or Flusterstorm can help stop a lot of wins where your opponent has exact mana. Finally, I just want to offer a quick blurb about some fun (for us, not for our opponents) cards I’ve made room for in this deck. Narset, Parter of Veils is the first card that pops into my head as this girl is rude. Remember Leovold, Emissary of Trest ? This has the same unbelievably cursed effect and dodges creature specific removal. Is your opponent looking for a win out of the yard? Maybe they’re about to resurrect Razaketh the Foulblooded before you’ve even had a turn? Faerie Macabre is here to help you shut that down. One last option I’ve thrown in is Gilded Drake . This is a highly meta-dependent call. I run into a fair amount of hatebears, value generating creatures, and other problematic things that this helps address. There have been some other meta-dependent or potentially budget-busting cards I’ve called out here so there’s a pretty big maybeboard for this deck. Take a look at it and see if there are any cards you think you’d rather include. The full list is below. Full Decklist Alright! That’s all folks! Thanks a ton for reading through this article. I wish you good luck and happy hunting with either of these decks. If you have any commander’s you’d like to see me go over in future articles like this, let me know in the comments or on Hexdrinkers Twitter. Next week I’ll be going over yet another Naya commander, as it is the best color combination… Hold on, I think I hear someone ringing The Hexdrinkers doorbell. Looks like the Azorius Senate. I’ll deal with these schmucks and get back to you as soon as I can. The Top Shelf &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;On the Hunt for Combos (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/the%20top%20shelf/2020/07/16/TTS-WhaleWolf.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;the godfather (brawl)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/07/13/vito_brawl.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/0/f/0fe79ee4-c3f3-4a6b-a967-203ca3b70ee5.jpg?1592761215&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;The Godfather (Brawl)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Enter The Guildhall&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome back for another exciting Brawl deck tech! I know, I know. It’s been a while but I promise between &lt;em&gt;M21&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jumpstart,&lt;/em&gt; the time for Brawl has never been better. With Wizards announcing recently that Brawl will now be available every day for &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; and Historic Brawl seeing a little more attention from the big guys upstairs, we are truly living in a Golden Age. It does bring up the question of will we still be seeing powerful old legends backfilled into the format like we did in the Guildhalls. For now I’m going to revel in the ability to play my favorite format every day!&lt;/p&gt; So, let’s celebrate the only way I know how… brewing a new deck chock full synergy, power, and a dash of ruthlessness. I’m about to make a deck you can’t refuse… My family has finally gotten around to watching the Corleone crime saga and if nothing else is bringing us together in Quarantine, it’s Michael cleaning house of the snitches and hooligans that have tried to have him and his family killed. As Godfather he continues to create a crime empire that spans the country and knows no rivals. That might be a little out of scope for a deck build, but here at Hexdrinkers world domination is never far from our mind…instead we’ll focus on Michael’s inspiration for his long lasting empire! Nothing Al Pacino does would be possible without the foundation laid by his father, Vito. Core Set 2021 Introduced us to Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose and lemme tell ya, I’m impressed. Taking a classic Magic enchantment like Sanguine Bond , throwing it on a stick for two mana less is great. With the right crew, I don’t think it’ll take much to reach Vito’s maximum potential and before long our opponents will be sleeping with the fishes. One for Me, Two For You Ah pinging, the shin-kicks of Magic. Always annoying and not lethal by itself but still capable of inflicting a serious amount of damage. With Vito out, that trouble is doubled. Think of these guys as the street level enforcers. For each life gained, we’ll be dealing more damage directly to our opponents, essentially halving their clock with one of these repeatable engines on the board. Ill-Gotten Inheritance was a draft all star, ending games if you didn’t have an answer. While it’s a little slow for Standard, it fits just perfectly into our Vito shell. Add on the sac ability to potentially deal eight damage to our opponent?? This card should definitely not be taken lightly. Ayara, First of Locthwain joins forces with Syr Konrad, the Grim to just hammer our opponents for any creature entering the battlefield, leaving the battlefield, never reaching the battlefield. No matter what any other creature is doing - it’ll bring the pain to whoever is on the other side of the table. Dread Presence requires a couple land drops, but for the ability to deal two-to-four damage per turn outside of combat, this is not a hard condition to meet. Also, if Vito is currently unavailable - locked in his office listening to the plea of a fishmonger (since no Sicilian can deny a request on his daughter’s wedding day), Dread Presence can be drawing you an extra card per turn Phyrexian Arena style. It’s incredibly versatile. Okay, okay hear me out on Tavern Swindler . In most decks, terrible. In the long run you’ll be gaining just as much life as you’re losing and the odds just aren’t worth it. But, but, in a deck that capitalizes on the mere act of gaining life this card is pretty buckwild. Consider the average of gaining six life every other turn, now consider that with Vito on the board. We’re going to be dealing six damage directly to our opponents on a fairly regular basis without even attacking! Even if it takes us a few turns to start the pain train, this deck sports enough life gain to make the sacrifice worth it. …And of course in some games, you’ll be hitting your opponent for sixevery turn. Editor’s note: This is coming from a guy who runs Okaun, Eye of Chaos and Zndrsplt, Eye of Wisdom in Commander so keep an eye on his coin flipping. Throw in copies of Serrated Scorpion , Bastion of Remembrance , and Sanctum of Stone Fangs for pinging redundancy and I’d be surprised if our opponent can escape ankles un-shanked. The Bosses Pinging is all well and good, but things really start getting scary when we’re gaining lots of life on purpose. Primarily, this means creatures with lifelink swinging in or making use of Vito’s secondary ability. Murderous Rider certainly needs no introduction. As non-conditional creature and planeswalker removal at a decent price, there’s not a black deck that wouldn’t run this card. Throw in the fact that this 2/3 could be dealing four combined damage a turn and it’s all upside. Every self-respecting crime organization needs a hitman. Cavalier of Night is more conditional to activate it’s powerful destroy trigger, but at the end of the day it’s still a 4/5 with lifelink swinging for a potential eight each turn and a recursion ability that can get us back Murderous Rider , Grim Dancer , or even a Vampire of the Dire Moon . The Haunt of Hightower , the often overlooked Buy-A-Box promo for Ravnica Allegiance is a weird, but I assure you this vampire can put in some serious work. If your opponent values their life, they cannot let this live. The Haunt will continue to grow each turn with more and more life gained as your opponent loses all their cards. If nothing else, this card will immediately lure any removal your opponent has out of the woodwork. And ya know…the more I look at it, the more I feel like this card is the nega- Dream Trawler … I don’t think we’d be too far off to include Dreadhorde Invasion and Duskfang Mentor either. While not as flashy as the other lifelinkers, the support is very much appreciated. Obliteration All good things must eventually come to an end, and our games are no exception. After a while, it becomes tiring playing with our opponent’s life total, toying with them, and now it’s time to deal the killing blow. But where do we look for a card that could gain us an obscene amount of life to deal that much damage to our opponents?? I don’t know what Asphodel’s got going on, but it’s straight up scary when Vito comes to town. Our other main win-con is Erebos’s Intervention which trades devotion for paying mana, but we don’t get to hit twice. For consistency, we’ll include a Grim Tutor (which costs a single wild card! Booyah!!), and some other powerful black cards like Massacre Wurm just to cover our bases. 90% of the time, Vito will pull through. The other 10% we throw a giant wurm at ‘em and hope for the best. In Conclusion So there you have it! Whether you want to start your own criminal empire, or just drive your opponents into a rage with every life gained - Vito is your guy. A low cost commander who can enter the board quick and immediately start pulling his weight with the first Radiant Fountain . In an initial run, Vito went 3-2 with losses to Yarok, the Desecrated and a Thassa, Deep-Dwelling / Agent of Treachery soft-lock. Wins against Niv-Mizzet, Reborn , Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy , and Illuna, Apex of Wishes have me feeling pretty confident in the power level of this deck before any fine-tuning. Some things to keep in note though: you always, always want to start with a low-cost lifelinker in your hand. Being able to drop a Boot Nipper or Grimdancer early is vital for success in ramping up the damage by the time your opponent is able to respond. I’d also really consider getting a Grim Tutor if you want to play this deck or anything mono-black in general. The sheer versatility to grab either of our finishers or a removal spell is key, and directly responsible for our Kinnan win by being able to fetch Gray Merchant of Asphodel .

Welcome back to another installment of &lt;em&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/em&gt;, our first for &lt;em&gt;Core 21&lt;/em&gt;. This new core set is an absolute treasure trove for all sorts of formats and playstyles and it contains several enchantments that could become our titular engines. When deciding on what to brew around I considered obvious standouts like &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/m21/28/nine-lives?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/7/e70b7a73-484e-48f1-944c-3d38866cdc20.jpg?1592760676&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Nine Lives &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/m21/142/double-vision?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/7/5/754b77b4-4cc4-4e49-a7a4-667401e7e063.jpg?1592761301&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Double Vision &lt;/a&gt;, or even the Shrine cycle (these aren’t out of the running though, so … stay tuned). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; But ultimately, I decided on a card that no one was talking about. A card that spoke to my simplest and purest form of playstyle: Griffin Aerie . A humble and overlooked uncommon, Griffin Aerie is simple yet efficient in its design and it almost epitomizes what I want to do in Magic. At two mana, it can come down early and isn’t a big investment that sets us back if it quickly gets removed or bounced (cough cough Offspring’s Revenge cough cough). It doesn’t have any activated abilities, just a singular sentence detailing a simple requirement with a simple payoff: you gain three life on your turn, we’ll let you enlist a feathered friend from our aerie. Griffin Aerie isn’t a card that’s over the top, and its condition isn’t insurmountable. It’s fairly easy to trigger just by engaging in combat with lifelink or playing spells that have incidental lifegain, several of which exist in Standard. In return, the payoff is moderate. A 2/2 with flying is pretty good, but it’s nothing ridiculous and it’s hard to truly abuse. Griffin Aerie is a card that sits there and allows you to play like normal and given some deckbuilding considerations will provide a fat stack of advantage over the course of the game. Beautiful. You Only Live Thrice So we already have our rough gameplan: gain at least three life a turn and that will keep us alive while we beat face with an army of eagle-lion-things, more commonly known as griffins. Currently in Standard there are a surprising number of cards that gain us exactly three life. Revitalize , Healer of the Glade , and Ajani, the Greathearted are all options that hit that sweet spot. But what’s even more surprising is how many of these are good. Why settle for these when you could have Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath ? Exactly. Other cards that have seen significant play already include Absorb as a good answer to haymakers or anything with an ETB and Knight of Autumn which has a mode for every situation. We’re comfortably in Bant with these picks and other cards like Elite Guardmage scratch that sweet spot for my value loving brain, but believe it or not, we can also branch in black to find spicier picks. Basilica Bell Haunt, one of the stars of the Offspring’s Revenge article, helps strip our opponent of resources so they can’t defend against our griffin army. If we were playing knights, a Blacklance Paragon (begrudgingly cast during main phase one) is an option. In a mill deck, Creeping Chill would be a star player. Spoiler: we aren’t playing either of those, but they are a route you could go down just to show the versatility of the aerie. Even a personal Eldraine favorite, Clackbridge Troll can trigger our aerie. And if it isn’t, we’re smashing for eight which is just as acceptable. Between the troll and Indulging Patrician , a card perfectly tailored to back up our army of griffins, we’ll be doling out quite the beatdown while brimming with life. Another One As DJ Khaled said, we want another one; another three life, another griffin, all of the above. Since a lot of our lifegain comes in the form of ETBs, this deck is perfect for the host of blink and bounce effects in Standard right now. Thassa, Deep-Dwelling is the go-to for recurring ETBs. Formerly a force of evil who would endlessly trigger Agent of Treachery , she’ll now be blinking our Bell-Haunts and Guardmages to bring us that sweet, sweet value. Her best friend is Charming Prince who already gains us the three life we need right off the bat, but can also help us find our pieces as well as blink something else himself, such as a Guardmage to draw us an additional card. Two more new Core 21 cards to keep the griffin trail rolling are Niambi, Esteemed Speaker and Barrin, Tolarian Archmage . At home alongside Teferi, Time Raveler both in function and lore, these can both bounce our creatures (with upside!) so we can cast them again for maximum griffins. Barrin will get us an additional card if we bounce our own things or he can just as easily give us tempo advantage by bouncing a flying blocker. Niyambi will gain us the life we need if we bounce something, easy griffins. Ten Points to Gryffindor Companion Yorion, Sky Nomad Creatures 3x Barrin, Tolarian Archmage 4x Charming Prince 4x Elite Guardmage 3x Knight of Autumn 3x Niambi, Esteemed Speaker 4x Thassa, Deep-Dwelling 4x Uro, Titan of Nature&#39;s Wrath 2x Yorion, Sky Nomad Enchantments 4x Griffin Aerie Instants 3x Absorb 3x Growth Spiral 2x Lofty Denial 3x Revitalize Planeswalkers 1x Ajani, Great-Hearted 4x Teferi, Time Raveler Lands 4x Breeding Pool 4x Fabled Passage 5x Forest 4x Hallowed Fountain 6x Island 6x Plains 4x Temple Garden This Bant list does a lot of cool things and plays a lot of powerful cards, but during my research I thought I would be remiss if I didn’t give a second take. Black has such a deep pool as we discussed earlier and would provide a different play experience. Plus some of my favorite cards from the research phases are in black and I need to show them some love. This version of the deck relies much less on blinking and bouncing, forgoing that for more grindy cards with more removal and resource denial. I also liked experimenting with more one- and two-of’s to provide consistently new play patterns as well as try out some sweet cards (like Chevill, Bane of Monsters , my co-founder). Slam Dunk in that Aerie, Call Me Blake Griffin Creatures 3x Basilica Bell-Haunt 4x Charming Prince 1x Chevill, Bane of Monsters 3x Clackbridge Troll 1x Elder Gargaroth 4x Indulging Patrician 2x Knight of Autumn 2x Scavenging Ooze Enchantments 2x Dawn of Hope 1x Ethereal Absolution 4x Griffin Aerie Instants 3x Dire Tactics 3x Eliminate 2x Erebos&#39;s Intervention Sorceries 1x Sanguine Indulgence Lands 4x Fabled Passage 2x Forest 4x Godless Shrine 3x Overgrown Tomb 4x Plains 4x Swamp 3x Temple Garden And that wraps up this installment of Rev Your Engines, I hope you’ll be flying high trying this deck out. Remember not to overlook the less flashy cards as often they can be great centerpieces as well and really force you to be creative in deckbuilding.

So we’ve got a bit of a different article set-up for you today. In an effort to promote the differences between our deck-building and theory-crafting, we’ve decided to put together a brand new series called &lt;em&gt;DUEL DECKS&lt;/em&gt;! Basically, we’ll be picking up the slack for Wizards who dropped the classic Duel Decks line a couple years ago with our own crazy builds featuring the best of match-ups. To start things off, we thought we’d jump right into the ridiculously powerful &lt;em&gt;Core Set 2021&lt;/em&gt; that was just released…&lt;/p&gt; You see, we’ve been having a bit of an argument over the superior household animal and I need your help proving him wrong once and for all. That’s right. Chev and his felines are facing off against Julian’s canines: it’s Cats Versus Dogs. Cats Core set 2021 is the redemption cats need after their failed attempt on the silver screen. Between Feline Sovereign and Pridemalkin we’re seeing some absolute stunners represented which is only making the case for kitten superiority stronger. But first, let me introduce you all to someone. He’s been with my family for about half the time of me or my sister, but has already been elevated to favorite child. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s listed first in my parents’ will. What? You dare accuse me of trying to use cute cat photos to convince you that cats are superior? Why that’s, that’s outrageous! I would never! ..Is it working? Cat Kong There are probably two main ways you can take a cat Commander build: Wide ( Jazal Goldmane , Jedit Ojanen of Efrava , Mirri, Weatherlight Duelist ) or Equipment ( Nazahn, Revered Blacksmith , Balan, Wandering Knight , Kemba, Kha Regent ). We’ll be focusing on the wide archetype. Equipment is cool, but I generally prefer to measure fun in CCPM. Or “Cats cast per minute” and the wide strategy has a much stronger CCPM score. So who do we choose to lead our legion of leopards?! Back in 2017, Wizards designed the Commander set around particular tribes of popular Magic creatures. While some of you might be more familiar with Edgar Markov and The Ur-Dragon , This magnificent creature also made quite the appearance: That’s right, a freaking savage, world-roaring CAT! Where were dogs Julian? Probably out sniffing their butts or something. Arahbo ushered in a new era for cat-kind in our favorite casual format by not only being an absolute stud, but also finding ways to provide value wherever our furry friend ends up thanks to eminence. He is exactly what cats need to conquer the multiverse! Muwahahaha… huh? Who said that? Let’s uhh, let’s take a look at the deck! Feline Ferocity Arahbo, Roar of the World always allows us to buff one cat per turn +3/+3, but if he’s on the board, we also can pay {1}{G}{W} for each attacking cat to double its power and toughness. Okay, that’s pretty beast. I mean common household aggro name Xenagos, God of Revels can only double one creature’s stats a turn and he’s a GOD. Point, Arahbo. To best utilize Arahbo’s bounty of beautiful abilities we want to lean heavily on the aggressive nature of our commander and be dropping cats left and right. I want to overwhelm our enemies with cuddly cuteness and claws of steel. Luckily, most cats tend to agree. There are a bajillion ways to generate cat tokens in this deck, these are just the top few. Even better, a lot of the token generation doesn’t even involve tapping, so we can ball out on the attack and still come back with double the number of war-ready cheetahs. (Well, unless you’re poor Pride Sovereign who finds generating tokens so strenuous they have to take two turns off to recover. Taking a nap, drinking some Eternal’s blood, whatever Amonkhet cats do) This allows us to utilize the benefits of Arahbo the most, by giving us as many targets as possible with doubled stats, if we have the mana to back that up. Once we do, this can easily start snowballing. Of course, you might be a little hesitant to spend your mana doubling the power of a legion of 1/1s. Hey I don’t blame yah. Good thing we got lords for DAYZ. Be they true feline or leonin, cats have been getting buffed since the early 2000s. Dogs…I mean, they got Pack Leader …which is cute and oh so fluffy, but here’s areminder of what the cats are working with? Just get one of these bad boys on the field and we’re already talking about our 1/1 tokens becoming 4/4s with Arahbo’s boost. Not to mention the glorious inclusion of Beastmaster Ascension , Mirari’s Wake , Overwhelming Stampede , and True Conviction to add even more base power. We’re all about redundancy. Just imagine an army of these absolute chonks coming at ya. You’d run. I’d run. And we all know a dog would run. Aide-de-Camp We’ve also got a friend from Ikoria who serves as Arahbo’s right-hand cat in the war against canines, Kaheera, the Orphanguard . Kaheera provides support as another lord for our army, and a giver of vigilance, a fantastic buff allowing us both offense and defense. Taking advantage of the absolutely bonkers way the companion mechanic is integrating with Commander, i.e. allowing us a 101st card, this allows Kaheera to be an essential 9th card in our starting hand meaning instant lord access. Yes, the companion change means I need to drum up 3 mana first to get Kaheera into my hand but she’s still suuuper powerful. And we’re in green so like, nbd. Insult to Injury Sometimes, buff cats just aren’t enough. Even with a powerful second-in-command and Arahbo dropping buffs like a cleric, we might need to call in a helping hand. We need something like… Which also just got reprinted! Just to be safe, we also have Mirror Entity waiting in the wings to provide a party buff, and more individual tactical advantages like Berserk and Hunter’s Prowess if we need to deliver the death strike with a single Serpopard. Psssst You know this last one might not even be fair. I can’t in good conscience give you this strat. Dogs probably haven’t deserved this absolute obliteration… …so I’ll tell you, whatever you do, do not add Nine Lives and Solemnity to your build. And especially no tutors like idyllic Tutor or Enlightened tutor . That would, that would be terrible. Sure, all dogs might go to heaven - but cats can live forever (with the right enchantment). Cats Cats Cats Decklist Dogs The domesticated portion of the canine family tree that we know as dogs have been called many things; fluffers, floofers,woofers, puppies, doggos, good boys and girls, just to name a few. But never have they been called hounds. This was a mistake that Magic had been making since the game’s inception (minus Zodiac Dog, Portal was weird). But the release of Core 2021 and Jumpstart we have been given a blessing in the errata of the hound creature type to dog. And with this change, Wizards has started to give doggos the love that they deserve in the form of true tribal support, something that those wretched cats have been receiving en masse for the past few years . And most of the cat tribal support until just recently derives from lion men being a thing in Magic for forever, which I think is a little unfair. I believe dogs and wolves (both the were and non-were varieties) should be able to run in the same pack, but alas. As a proud dog owner and lover since I was born, it’s only natural that I remind the world who the best pets are with a dog-themed Commander deck! And also I want to put Chev in his place… A Bite to Back Up the Bark Dogs come in all different breeds, and despite there only being a measly 89 dogs printed in the game’s nearly 30 year history, they can be found in all 5 colors! Since dogs have been printed so sparingly, Wizards hasn’t had time to really find the sweet spot on canine design. I’m not gonna sugarcoat it: most of these cards aren’t… competitive. However, there are a few floofers that I want to draw attention to. The best and newest is Pack Leader . The only dog lord, he is absolutely essential for our pack to succeed. Also from Core 21 is Selfless Savior . Many people have said that they would die for their dog, but this little pup is willing to put himself on the line for our cause. Being able to protect our Pack Leader or another crucial canine is a godsend. Hailing from Tarkir and bringing back memories of our foundational Magic days are Ainok Guide and Ainok Survivalist . The former helps fix our five color mana base and the latter, along with newcomer Rambunctious Mutt , is great at picking off an opposing Coat of Arms or Mirari’s Wake (that’s right Chev, I see the shenanigans you’re up to playing real cards). Two more powerful and more ferocious options are Underworld Cerberus and his counterpart Kunoros, Hound of Athreos . When people have signs that read “Beware of Guard Dog,” they’re talking about these guys. No one is getting close to their graveyards when these guys are around. Man’s Best Friend Now, if the puppers were just going at it alone, it would be a rough time. But, luckily, dogs aren’t known as ‘Man’s Best Friend’ for nothing. We’ve got a whole team of breeders, walkers, trainers, etc in tow to support these furballs! First up is Alpine Houndmaster . A new addition, this guy brings along his two best buddies right to our hand for some sick card advantage. Speaking of card advantage, Den Protector , Archaeomancer , and Snapcaster Mage all make sure that we continually have toys for our dogs to play with, while Gerrard, Weatherlight Hero makes sure that we continually have doggos to play with our toys Lastly we have Drannith Magistrate and Containment Priest to make sure that those tricksy cats (or reanimation players) can’t cheat us. Two for One Now, we are bringing a few more creatures who are simultaneously Man and Best Friend: changelings. There’s a running joke that Chameleon Colossus is the best insert tribe here and it’s no different for dogs. Our changelings are generally powerful and also receive all the bonuses for being a dog while also being a human. Irregular Cohort , Taurean Mauler , and Graveshifter are all welcome additions to the pack. Which now leads us to the elephant (dog? changeling?) in the room. “Julian”, I rhetorically say to myself alone in my room in a voice meant to mimic you readers, “This is a Commander deck, who’s our general?” To which I say, “I have some unfortunate news kids.” There is no* dog commander. Kunoros and Isamaru, Hound of Konda are legendary dogs, but they don’t provide the color depth needed to shelter our strays. Rin and Seri, Inseparable while an interesting card in design space is absolute heresy when we’re here to show the cats that dogs are superior. We cannot have a cat in power. And thus we turn to technicalities. Morophon, the Boundless has helmed many an under-supported tribal deck and they’ll do the same for us. Providing us mana cost reductions while also buffing our dogs (or humans, depending on our board at the time we cast him) will secure him a spot as the pack alpha. Throw a Dog a … If there’s one thing that dogs love to do, it’s play! Cats are lame. They just sit around, do their own thing, and only seek human attention when it’s dinner time. Dogs want love, affection, and for their owner to stop playing arena and go outside to throw a bone or ball. (Of course since this is a war against the feline menace, we generally will be playing with sharper and pointier toys, but we do have a few balls to toss.) Mirari and it’s Wake are both important for us. Fixing and accelerating is crucial in a five color deck and being able to copy things like Swords to Plowshares or even an Eladamri’s Call can get us out of hairy situations. Sword of Fire and Ice and Sword of Feast and Famine (among others, we’re playing five swords), aren’t exactly a T-bone for our pups to gnaw on, but they will sure help us hold back the cat crusade. And of course we also have to suit up our doggos with some Lightning Greaves and Swiftfoot Boots so they can chase Arahbo and Brimaz out of town. And of course, at the end of the day, we’ll be flying our Vanquisher’s Banner , or more likely using it to wipe the mud and blood off our dogs’ feet. Can’t have them tracking it through the house. It’s a Dog Eat Dog World It’s ruff out there, especially for dogs in Magic. But these most recent sets are looking like they might teach the old dogs some new tricks. This deck is not exactly powerful, but it’s fun and on theme! We’re running tutors and good removal to shore up our lack of powerhouse dogs. Soon enough though, we’ll have enough tribal support for a real deck that can go toe to toe with the tribal giants like Elves and Merfolk. (Also to provide a contingency we are running the Academy Rector , Kaervek’s Spite , Barren Glory combo which is not one you see, like… ever. Figured we could mix things up, especially if Chev is talking about Solemnity shenanigans, that degenerate.) Doggos Go! Decklist So, there you have it! Two fantastic new tribal decks featuring some of Magic’s goodest boys, and fantastic felines. Which side will you chose? Duel Decks &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tribal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cats Versus Dogs (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/duel%20decks/2020/07/10/dd1_catvdogs.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;only the luckiest of clovers (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/on%20the%20rocks/2020/07/06/otr4_naya_adventures.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/7/c/7c5d0560-f9e6-4c70-8cce-cae61e4e74bc.jpg?1572490518&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Only The Luckiest of Clovers (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;On the Rocks&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome back one and all to the fourth installment of &lt;em&gt;On the Rocks&lt;/em&gt;! Jund Food was so much fun last time and piloting it reminded me of the power, but also the fun play patterns, of &lt;em&gt;Throne of Eldraine&lt;/em&gt; cards (yes yes, I know there are some who would beg to differ).&lt;/p&gt; With that on the mind, I decided to virtually sleeve up an Adventure deck, but not one that’s been in the limelight. This time we’re playing Naya Adventures! I love the Lucky Clover / Edgewall Innkeeper core and I figured we should give some love to the lesser used adventure cards.

I’m Eric and I’ll be your guide for most of this series. I am being brought on to add a new voice and additional perspectives to &lt;em&gt;Hexdrinkers&lt;/em&gt;. You can read more about me and find other articles by me on my author page here (https://hexdrinkers.com/authors/eric.html)! &lt;em&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/em&gt; is a new series, focusing on unique commanders that have exciting potential in both competitive and casual magic. There are a lot of commanders that fall into this category but we’ll start with one that I have been interested in for a long time: &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/c19/38/atla-palani-nest-tender?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/f/6/f6aa473b-85cd-431d-844b-218368fe955e.jpg?1568003640&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Atla Palani, Nest Tender &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Her ability initially makes you wonder what ‘Eggs ‘are there in Magic and how good are they? Don’t let the eggs fool you though, for the competitive build we’re looking at today the real eggs aren’t eggs at all. Instead they are Changelings! Creature’s with the Changeling ability count as eggs, which is just fine for our purpose. Atla was originally a secondary commander in C19. The base deck was designed to continuously create and copy tokens. Jumping off from that point would typically make you think of creatures that make tokens or a large battlecruiser deck that cheats some mana through sacrificing eggs. We’ll even be going into one of those later in this article. But for now, we’re going to look at Atla as a combo focused commander. I’m not Even Yolking, It Works Atla has a bespoke combo that works with her triggered ability. It requires us to run the following cards: Mirror Entity , a card that does damage when it enters or leaves the battlefield, and a card which can shuffle our graveyard back in when it dies. Additionally, Atla needs to have either a temporary stat bonus for the turn or a +1/+1 counter. The good news is that we only need Atla, Mirror Entity , and the buff in play to actually start the combo. The rest can be in our deck, our graveyard, or even exiled from the game. Let’s step through the combo now to just get a base example of how it works. With both Atla Palani, Nest Tender and Mirror Entity on the field, give Atla at least +1/+1 then activate Mirror Entity ’s ability for zero mana an arbitrarily large number of times. This will set the toughness of all your creatures to zero and makes them all eggs, but Atla will survive due to the buffs we just gave her. Mirror Entity will die and cause the next creature in your deck to flip onto the field. It too will be an egg with zero toughness, so it’ll die and rotate out as well. This repeats until we run out of creatures. We can loop this process by shuffling our graveyard back into the deck with a card like Kozilek, Butcher of Truth . Finally, Goblin Arsonist will eventually kill all our opponents by pinging them each time it leaves the battlefield. Protecting Our Nest Eggs Most competitive EDH metas are rife with stax and other defensive tools to prevent combo wins like ours. So, included in this deck are a variety of creatures who will help remove those obstructions as we cycle through with the Atla combo. Goblin Sharpshooter can kill any creature without Hexproof and Manglehorn can do the same for artifacts. We’re even running Caustic Caterpillar to get around things that shut off enter the battlefield effects. Riftsweeper can recover any of our helpful creatures that have been exiled, offering us some protection against even instant speed graveyard hate. So if you’re feeling bold you can try to combo off in the face of almost any defensive setup and just see if the heart of the cards is on your side. These creatures will do a lot of work toward protecting us after we’ve entered the loop, but we’ll need some protection beforehand as well. Naya doesn’t have a very wide selection of cards that fall into that category. However, we can still find some powerful cards among them, see Pyroblast and Red Elemental Blast . Additionally, bask in the groans of the table every time you get to cast Veil of Summer and Autumn’s Veil . Naya Can’t Combo… Unless? Competitive decks can struggle if they only have one route to victory. So, in order to avoid those issues we’re going to run a suite of other typical combos that fall into our colors. The first ones that come to mind for most are the variations involving Kiki Jiki, Mirror Breaker . We’re going to be running multiple cards that allow for different infinites with Kiki as well as Splinter Twin to add consistency. Offense isn’t going to be enough to get us across the line though. On the scale of cEDH decks, we don’t expect to keep up with Tier 0 decks, but we do need to be able to stop some decks faster than ours. In order to do this we’ll be running a light stax package to compete with those strategies. But not to worry, we won’t hurt our own game plan too much. Root Maze and Kataki, War’s Wage have always stood out to me as solid cards for the format given the omnipresence of artifacts. Both Thalia, Heretic Cathar and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben will also give us a chance to pump the brakes on other common strategies. A few of our other powerhouse defensive cards are shown below. Easter Egg Hunt Now, for the final question: How are we going to find and play all these cards we just talked about? To play our main combo in one turn is a minimum of eight mana, including four colored mana (WWRG). In order to find all our pieces and have the mana to play them, ramp and tutors are going to be key. We run an interesting mix of ramp packages to make sure that our hate cards (and those of our opponents) don’t end up hitting us too hard. Mana dorks, such as Birds of Paradise , Bloom Tender , and Arbor Elf are always good to have around, so we’ll toss a few of those in. Artifact ramp is a staple in cEDH if only due to its raw power. So including cards like Mana Vault and Sol Ring can help us accelerate to key turns when it really matters. Finally, by rounding out with a few choice enchantments, shown below, we end up with a very strong looking ramp package. Of course, draw engines such as Sylvan Library will always have their place, but we want to go even faster. So instead we’re looking for direct tutors such as Altar of Bone and Sylvan Tutor . Some of our alternate win conditions require us to find enchantments so we’ll be running Enlightened Tutor and Academy Rector as well. Most of our wins require specific creatures though, which green does a fantastic job of tutoring for with cards like Chord of Calling and Finale of Devastation . We run a lot of tutors so I won’t go into all of them, but a few more of our choice selection are shown below: Well, that is all on our competitive deck. With this guide on the build you can feel free to make your own meta dependent switches. In the sideboard of the deck I call out a few helpful cards that can be subbed in depending on budget and meta. Even if your first few matches end up being a bit scrambled or hard boiled, I’m sure you’ll be winning matches over easy in no time! (I’m not even close to sorry about the egg puns). Full Decklist All Our Eggs In One Basket Let’s take a step back now that we’ve finished one of our decks. We originally said this commander would be great for a less competitive build focused on eggs, tokens, and the sweet sweet taste of battlecruiser magic. Well, I’m excited to let you know that’s exactly what we’re talking about next. This build is going to run you under $200 and should fit in a more casual and/or combat focused meta. Atla Palani, Nest Tender will still be front and center, but we still have one lurking question about this deck… How many eggs are we allowed to run? Dragon Egg was printed not too long ago, so surely there should be plenty in magic’s long history, right? And that’s it! All the Naya eggs. Wait, that’s it? Frantically checking notes. That can’t be it, right? How are we going to make this deck work with four eggs? Well, we’re going to have to rely on Atla’s slightly underwhelming activated ability for the most part. But, we still have some good news coming! Nesting Dragon is able to crank out at least an egg a turn while we’re hitting our land drops. Additionally, there are a few changelings that we can run to fill in our empty nest. (PSA, do not try to activate Mirror Entity’s ability for 0 in this deck. You will not enjoy the results.) What if we clone our eggs?. Atla and Nesting Dragon both make egg tokens, so populating and doubling tokens can be very powerful for us… Of course a lot of token doublers would bust our budget pretty hard, but Second Harvest is a great fit and Growing Ranks is a good example of a repeated populate effect. We’re also going to be on the lookout for cards that give us other benefits in addition to copying our eggs, such as the following cards: Loot Boxes, In My Card Game? Well, now it’s time to hatch those eggs and find out just what is inside! In order to cycle through these eggs fast enough to see our powerful cards, we’re going to need some sacrifice outlets or ways to crack these eggs. In Naya we don’t have a ton of options, but they definitely exist. For example, Greater Gargadon and Dragon Broodmother allow us to add more top end to our deck and start off our sacrifice package right. Martyr’s Cause offers us a good defensive option and can set up a strong counter punch. Switching out one of our eggs for a beefy blocker can seriously disrupt our opponent’s plans. I also want to offer a specific call out for Slaughter the Strong which allows us to sacrifice all our eggs, keep Atla on the field, and clear the way for all the creatures about to hatch. Artifacts are going to let us fill out the rest of this package. We’re going to be running a pretty tight selection of creatures so that every time we crack an egg we either get another egg or a powerful creature. Enter the battlefield triggers will really help exaggerate the effects we get from cheating mana. Combustible Gearhulk and Ravager Wurm are both cards that immediately present a strong board presence and give us an upside when they come into play. Angel of Serenity and Terastodon also fall into this category as well. They help us keep the board clear as we’re hatching these massive creatures. Naya is also a home to creatures that are incredibly powerful when they get to sit on the field. Vigor is a pet card of mine that I think will do great work for us. It manages to simultaneously discourage people from attacking us or blocking our creatures. Aurelia, the Warleader is arguably one of the most powerful cards we get to include. Multiple combat steps can allow for massive and unexpected swing turns. Green Eggs and Ramp I think there’s some bad news coming though… We may not always get to turn a bunch of eggs into massive creatures at little to no cost. We may at some point need to start paying for these monsters, so mana ramp is going to be a prominent feature of our deck. Unfortunately we don’t get to use mana dorks because seeing one come out of an egg may actually break my heart. Let’s start with the land ramp. Explosive Vegetation and Rampant Growth are obvious classics for a ramp package. But, I’m here to offer the deep cuts, the B sides, of ramp. So let’s talk about Spoils of Victory and Collective Voyage . These cards are going to help us fetch stronger lands and more lands respectively. On the topic of getting more than one land, Khalni Heart Expedition and Tempt with Discovery can be very powerful as well (Never get tempted by someone else by the way). Lands aren’t the only way to ramp though, artifact ramp is in some ways even more powerful, but with its own weaknesses. The signets are a great way to start off at this power level, so let’s toss in the full set. Sol Ring is one of the best cards in this category and should be pretty easy to get your hands on. Commander’s Sphere and Fellwar Stone are also going to do great things for us in terms of mana fixing. Well, that concludes my analysis on this version of the deck. I tried to keep this to a budget that made sense to me, but I remember hating spending money on lands when I could get some game winning eight-drops for the same price. I’ve offered some higher end suggestions in the maybe board of the deck list. Feel free to make any substitutions you’d like though! This is a deck that can be driven in pretty much any direction. Tribal and Token themes could be more pronounced if that appealed to you. If you have any commanders you’d like to see me do an analysis of like this or any thoughts on the series feel free to let us know on Twitter or in the comments below!

They claim no one else even wanted to interview them…preposterous. Here is our unedited question section from that interview. Enjoy:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Q: Wow, THE Julian Leal and Chev Eldrid? It’s so good to finally meet you! I’ve been following you guys ever since that welcome article and continue to come back two times a week! JL: …Chev, what’s going on? Aren’t you the one writing this? CE: What? No, this is a very unbiased reporter who is also a big fan of ours. I’m just happy we could make the time for them. Please, continue. Q: Thank you Chev. Now we’ve known Hexdrinkers as a brand first, and its people second. Obviously Julian is the one responsible for classics like the “On The Rocks” series and Chev has really taken to the MTGA Brawl format, but aside from the writing we don’t know much about you both. JL: Yes we’re very private people. That’s why we like to keep our Twitter account as a single follower and keep our site relatively unlisted on Google. It’s what has helped us really cultivate our “elusive” persona. Q: That can’t possibly be on purpose. CE: …psh yeah it totally is, shut up. Q: Anyway, I’ve gathered a set of questions that I hope will shed some more light on who you two are, your favorite experiences with magic, and what makes you two unique in the world of mtg content producers. So with that I’d love to get started? JL: Perfect! Question 1: You both joined the game in the Khans block, right? What would you say has been your favorite standard set since joining in 2015? JL: It has to be what we started with: Dragons of Tarkir. So many interesting and flashy cards, especially the Dragon Lords. That’s how our LGS tempted us into trying Magic out. I’ve always loved 3-color decks since then and the abundance of legendaries helped us transition nicely into Commander. That was like the wild west back then, but it was super fun, figuring out how to actually play and trying out innocent fun brews before we knew anything about ‘tiers’ and ‘metas’. It’s that sort of style that we want to emulate and recreate. CE: I think I’d have to go with Dominaria. For me, even though the full history of Dominaria didn’t resonate with me as well as more enfranchised players, I still recognized a lot of the characters like Jhoira Weatherlight Captain and Karn, Scion of Urza . Dominaria was also the height of my paper involvement in the game thanks to a really welcoming FNM community when I was studying in New Zealand and the incredible amount of Brawl I played with Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive . 10/10 Would do it again. Question 2: Starting from one base color, what color combinations do you most resonate with up through the shards/wedges? JL: Blue for me. Yup, I’m that guy in our playgroup, despite not playing that many counterspells. I’ve always been a Johnny, and being able to play at instant speed, ready to react to any situation as well as creatively set up awesome plays and win-cons is exactly where I want to be. My first decks were prowess decks with big flyers and then transitioned into Simic value in Commander. Secondarily, it’s a toss-up between black and white, but I have to go with white, making me Azorius. White has everything I want in a support color as a control player. Powerful removal, excellent sideboard cards, and a few big flashy fliers to close out the game (I had a notorious angel deck in the early days of our playgroup). CE: Ask him why it was notorious, the answer may surprise you. JL: …Lastly, my shard identity would be Esper. My longest standing commander deck is Dakkon Blackblade control and my first “favorite” deck was Esper Dragons from Standard during Khans block and Origins. The combination of being able to deal with any permanent that hits the battlefield and the card advantage of blue and black is right where I want to be. Plus it includes some of my all time favorite cards Vindicate , Utter End (another love from Khans Block), and Anguished Unmaking . That being said, I’ve found homes in all colors and am actively working to move outside my comfort zone in all formats….. But if I had my way, I’d play Esper Control whenever I could. CE: While I initially leaned green, thanks to an absolutely bonkers Elf duel deck…I’ve definitely shifted more towards black in recent years as a primary color. I really like the idea of success at any cost. Sacrificing your own creatures or using your own life as a resource to get ahead. That philosophy actually inspired the Selenia, Dark Angel Commander deck I’ve had for years and still love piloting: take yourself down to near zero life just to swap with someone else. It’s all about using your own stability to take others down with you. I pick green back up in the two color identity, always having been a big fan of the Golgari utilizing that black theme and adding the warped growth of green when paired with black. This is especially true when looking at my Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons commander deck. Inflicting those -1/-1s upon myself and my armies to slowly wither you down with deathtouch snakes. It’s a riot! Lastly, I would say that Abzan is my three-color. I have the least amount of attachment to this identity but it was my first theme deck purchase with Ivorytusk Fortress back in Khans, and I continue to find myself scheming with Abzan commanders…even if none ever get assembled. Question 3: Is there any particular card in the game that you have particularly strong memories of? Good or bad. JL: Mirrorwing Dragon from Eldritch Moon. That card is sweeeeeet. It was the centerpiece of the first Standard deck that I brewed and fully built to play at FNM. The deck consisted of a bunch of good rate creatures and efficient pump spells so you could target the dragon and buff your whole team like crazy and swing out. The deck did reasonably well, was a lot of fun to play, and was a big personal victory for my deck-building infancy. CE: Oh, easily Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger . One of the first mythic rares I pulled and just the raw power emanating from that card…woof. It quickly became the centerpiece of an EDH deck that lives on today under Kozilek, the Great Distortion but has also fallen under Kruphix, God of Horizons and Animar, Soul of Elements . Eldrazi Tribal deck has always been one of my favorites, and I’m really hoping for some new tech in the fall Zendikar set. But yeah, Ulamog started it all. Question 4: If you had to forge a life somewhere in the multiverse, what plane would you most want to find yourself on? JL: Shandalar. It’s a “rogue plane,” it drifts through the Multiverse doing it’s own thing and not much is known about that. I like that sort of vibe and I like the peaceful and serene lifestyle of being off the beaten path, communing with nature, etc. Also, it’s super mana rich and all the artwork from there looks gorgeous, so it’d be great for someone who likes to be outside like myself. CE: I think…Kaladesh. Post Aether Revolt. Just an absolutely beautiful aesthetic that was brought to life in one of Magic storytellings more successful runs. As a software developer, I love the idea of a plane with technology built into its very core and as a set it introduced so many cool new cards and ideas (including a bunch of bannings but hey, Live Fast Die Young ). Question 5: What excites you most currently about Magic as a whole? JL: The breadth of ways to play. In the beginning we just lumped whatever cards we had together and fought it out in our basements. Then we jumped into Commander, later on started drafting, and now I’m playing competitively in Standard on Arena. We dabbled in other formats, but there’s still so many ways to play Magic that I want to experience and become knowledgeable about. CE: Currently? I’d say the depth. As we’re trying to start this website with our own ideas and views - we’re constantly discovering new strategies or archetypes that we can really sink our teeth into without stepping on too many toes. There’s always more to discover and explore. Question 6: So, we all know the Player Archetypes of Magic, but which do you think most resonate with you? JL: I said this earlier, but definitely Johnny. CE: Johnny, with a side of Vorthos. Julian will be the first to tell you of my propensity to play “bad cards” because I feel they either fall on-theme or I think they have more potential than they really do. Just ask him about Eternal Scourge and Ice Cauldron in my Eldrazi deck… JL: … I don’t wanna talk about those cards. Q: Wow! Well, I think that’s all we have time for today. Thank you so much for your time! I have to be off but I hope to see you both again soon! JL: WAIT! YOU CAN’T LEAVE ME ALONE WITH HIM HE- Meta &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A Casual Sitdown with the Founders&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/meta/2020/06/29/author_faq.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;you feelin’ hungry, punk?

Recently resurfacing with the recent bannings and rules change, has it returned to its former glory (the answer is not quite, but it’s still good).

Can’t be as bad as the Origins boxes Julian and I opened a little over 5 years ago…can it?&lt;/p&gt; Over these next couple weeks before release, we at Hexdrinkers thought we’d focus on some of the new cards joining us this summer. One of which has also inspired the first mono-red commander deck I’ve ever put together. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FORRRRR SUBIRA, TULZIDI CARAVANNER! She’s got haste, she’s got the ability to make our mini-minions unblockable, AND has a pretty handy take on red card draw. Get it? Handy? Ahhh I wonder if Julian will let that through editing EDITOR’S NOTE: (I did, I am sorry - Julian). Let’s take Subira’s textbox line-by-line while we start to form some ideas on how to build a deck that most accurately shows off this new legend’s power. Break it Down Haste Okay maybe we don’t need to spend so much time on this one BUT it does help highlight the aggressive nature of this no-nonsense caravan leader. You know we’ll be swinging on turn 3 at whoever still doesn’t have a creature out. There’s always one. {1}: Another target creature with power 2 or less can’t be blocked this turn. This is probably going to be the most important line on the entire card. Subira wants as many small creatures attacking as possible, but we’ll need the mana to pay for it. This seems like a less conditional, but more restrictive version of another Jamuraa legend we saw in C16, Sidar Kondo of Jamuraa . While that version doesn’t require an activation cost, I don’t think Sidar Kondo is nearly as powerful as Subira, and we’ll get to why in a minute. I also want to point out that Subira’s ability says another target creature can’t be blocked. So no shenanigans with a self-target and pumping for commander damage. {1}{R}, {T}, Discard Your Hand: Until end of turn, whenever a creature you control with power 2 or less deals combat damage to a player, draw a card. Ooooo boy. Okay. This whole “whenever a creature deals combat damage, draw a card” is not an ability we generally see in red. Like, at all. From a couple informed Scryfall searches I couldn’t find a single example of this ability being used outside of blue and green with cards like Bident of Thassa and Keeper of Fables . This is a big deal. Yes, the creatures have to have power two or less - but considering that’s the same condition for unblockability it reinforces the cornerstones of our deck. No concerns here. The only downside of course is discarding your whole hand…but I don’t think it’ll be as big a deal as we might think. We can also capitalize on it with cards like Glint-Horn Buccaneer and Brallin, Skyshark Rider . Bottomline, when combined with the above ability to make all our creatures unblockable, we’ll be drawing an obscene amount of cards in a color that generally struggles to do so. Take that Sidar Kondo. So we’ve got a commander that can push through damage AND draw us cards at a consistent rate, we just need to do it on her terms. Meaning we need an army of creatures that are power two or less. In Red. I wonder where we’re going to find them… Down, down to Goblin Town That’s right, it’s a caravan of goblins and Subira is leading them on a quest to pillage and loot until your opponents are crying for mercy. Goblins are by nature very low to the ground and annoying little punks which is exactly what we’re looking for. Whether it be through token generation, goblin tutors (which there are a surprising amount of), or just a lot of creatures, we’ll be filling the board quickly and effectively. Bring on the Goblins Focusing first on the incredible rate at which Goblins produce more goblins, it’s no surprise that most other goblin commanders are potent token generators. Krenko has a long history of bringing an overwhelming force of rage every turn, and while Pashalik is a newer addition to the scene - he’s just as ready to keep cranking out 1/1s. We’ve also got cards like Beetleback Chief and Empty the Warrens when Krenko or Pashalik can’t pull all the weight on their own. Our other main method of getting goblins into play is by tutoring and cheating them onto the battlefield. I’ll be honest, I did not expect this subtheme to be available, color me pleasantly surprised. Gosh darn it, these little goblin buggers are starting to earn my respect! Between Goblin Matron , Warren Instigator , and Goblin Lackey no matter what goblin we need - whether it be token generators or a tribal payoff - they’ll all be close at hand. Ankle Shanking So now we’ve got a board full of goblins, what do we do with them? Krenko and Pashalik brought all their friends to the party, but it’s Subira’s job to keep them entertained. Between Subira’s first ability, Purphoros, God of the Forge , Cavalcade of Calamity , and Boggart Shenanigans it doesn’t matter what our goblins are doing - our opponents will be feeling the pain. Goblin enters the battlefield, Purphoros and Impact tremors lay on the heat. Goblin attacks, get ready for Cavalcade of Calamity, and Raid Bombardment . Goblin dies, Boggart Shenanigans makes sure we have the last laugh. And When all that’s not enough, Gratuitous Violence and Fiery Emancipation raise the red pain train up to 11, turning even the minor-est of pings into a full blown smack. We’ve also got the Standard champ Torbran, Thane of Red Fell joining in on the fun! Now, I’m not a big math guy but if I do some calculations, carry the two, multiply by three… I think we’re looking at a metric %$@#-ton of damage per goblin. Draw, Go Once in a while we’ll feel like our hand is somewhat in need of a refresher, and Subira will need to make use of that secondary ability, giving us a whole lotta extra ammunition from our army of critters. We will need to spend two mana on the draw ability, so make sure you factor that into your unblockable mana-dump calculations. That is of course unless you’ve got a Battle Hymn or Brightstone Ritual in hand…then all bets are off. We’re also running Glint-Horn Buccaneer to take full advantage of the discard effect present on both Subira and cards like Faithless Looting . Even our “drawing” will hurt our opponents! Mwuahahaha! The Team Players Like any incredibly sinister plan to poke our opponents to death, this wouldn’t be possible without the hard work of plenty of other cards keeping our goblins happy, healthy, and unblocked. Give it up for the best of the rest! Helping Subira make the most of those many mini attacks we’ve got Kamigawa’s own Akki Underminer . A 1/1 goblin who makes our opponent sacrifice a permanent anytime it deals combat damage! Who designed this guy?! Don’t care, it’s a beast and I love it. Throne of the God-Pharaoh deals one extra helping of butt-whooping with each turn our goblin army attacks, and Shared Animosity triggers after we’d make creatures unblockable so we get an actual massive amount of damage through with just a few goblins! We’ve also got Meekstone , Red Elemental Blast , Deflecting Swat , and more keeping our board and commander safe from any sort of interaction from our pesky opponents. Lastly, the cleanup step. If our endless damage locomotive of goblins isn’t enough for an unparalleled victory we’ve got a couple extra tricks up our sleeve. Like any good red deck, we’ve got Insurrection as a solid Plan B and Price of Progress in the Plan C position to hopefully take everyone down at least ten life for daring to play multicolor decks. I mean, the nerve! And if all that doesn’t work. Well. Clearly a couple of your goblins must have stepped on their own mines like their buddy Goblin Kaboomist . Can’t be helped when dealing with the lil’ numskulls… I think that about wraps up how much I’m willing to say before giving you all the decklist but rest assured there are plenty of surprises left in store should you take this puppy for a drive! Enjoy everything Subira has to offer with her Goblin Caravan and stick around for more sick M21 builds!!

Whether you’re John Wick, the oblivious half of a rom-com couple, or perhaps the greatest comeback champ of all time: Taylor Swift.&lt;/p&gt; Love Story In our last Brawl Homebrew (found here), we explored the potential of an absolute blast from the past, Hanna, Ships Navigator , the Brawl Guildhall legend of the month. For me, it was love at first sight. Fresh off building an incredible Selesnya Auras deck championed by Siona, Captain of the Pyleas , I felt the switch to Azorius for similar Enchanted shenanigans would be relatively simple. Recursion of our Elspeth Conquers Death and Kiora Bests the Sea God seemed too good to pass up! But as we soon discovered, Magic has come a long way since Invasion and what was once an absolutely incredible ability comes in just too little too late 9 times out of 10. Legends like Yarok, the Desecrated or Snapdax, Apex of the Hunt continued to have the drop on our build making Hanna feel a bit like a liability. While we didn’t lose those games, they were always incredibly close. In fact our only loss was to… Another enchantment and artifact commander, except this one has an extra slew of keywords and doesn’t need to be tapped. It was a bloodbath. Alela and her flock (is a grouping of faeries called a flock? A mischief?) dive-bombed poor Hanna until there was nothing left. Absolute tragedy. But I know this is not the end Taylor Swift would approve of. No, if she were here she’d say to be Fearless, because in the wise words of the rocker herself, “Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want all over again… even though every time you’ve tried before, you’ve lost.” I can’t let T Swift down. Maybe Hanna just isn’t the right call for enchantments/artifacts in Brawl right now. Perhaps we’ll get more powerful artifact support down the line that will help her become an absolute powerhouse but for now, I need to look elsewhere if I want to succeed with an artifact and enchantment focused build. Maybe to Hanna’s greatest nemesis in the Brawl Guildhall. Look What You Made Me Do That’s right. It’s time to put on our war paint, get our act together, and bring the fight back to Alela. You know what that means: We’re going to build our own version of the legendary pushed-for-brawl faerie, but better, and it’s going to be absolutely awesome! The disappointing days of dropping enchantments and having to wait for them to leave the battlefield to get value from our commander are gone. As soon as Alela hits the field we’ll be filling it with a Mischief (I’ve decided that’s cooler sounding than a flock) of Faeries that don’t know the word “mercy”. Probably the biggest change to our deck is going to be a flyer subtheme. While Alela creates 1/1 flyers with every enchantment and artifact cast, she also gives all flyers +1/+0 because Alela takes no prisoners…and needed to sell pre-constructed Brawl decks. Divine Visitation is an absolute must for any token theme, trading all our meager 1/1s in for 4/4 Angels, ready to rain down holy hellfire on all those doubters. “In a relationship each person should support the other; they should lift each other up.” Alela provides Divine Visitation with an endless supply of tokens and Visitation makes them the angels they are. It’s a match made in heaven. Winged Words provides draw at an amazing rate with any flyers on the field, and Luminous Broodmoth makes sure any of our wingless support gets their chance in the sky. We’ll also be taking advantage of Archon of Sun’s Grace for even more flying tokens and enchantment synergy, as well as Ethereal Absolution to…okay I’m assuming you’re getting the idea by now. We’re going to have sooo many flyers, it’ll be great. Enchanted Since this deck was initially a derivation of our Hanna deck, there might be some redundancy in this cardpool but we’ll pick out some specific all-stars for the highlights. Most of our enchantments are still sitting squarely in Azorius, with Mire’s Grasp as our only mono-black one, but that’s to be expected. Elspeth Conquering death is quite a saga, and with that first turn being able to permanently exile someone’s commander or any real threat is truly Better Than Revenge. Smothering Tithe is a card I only recently invested a wildcard in and man, oh man was I missing out. Generating disposable mana is incredibly potent, especially against draw decks AND provides the perfect chump fodder against a Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God . All That Glitters should win some kind of record for being in all of our enchantment decks to date, but it’s just so good the decision is warranted. Even at its worst, it’ll give a creature +1/+1 and generate a flying 2/1 so I really can’t ever be complaining. Bad Blood But Chev, if we’re putting our faith in Alela what happens when we take the black? Well, a lot actually. Turns out adding black to our available cardpool is a great way to throw in powerful removal. Who knew?! That’s right, this time we’re not messing around. Yes, we’re still running Heliod’s Punishment and Banishing Light as a first line of defense (and synergy), but fool me twice? Baby, now we got Bad Blood and what we’re going to do will be pretty heartless. …Ready for It? Here’s the decklist, and don’t worry I’m not telling Hanna that We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together. I think she still has an incredible amount of utility because, I mean who can pass up the opportunity to drop Kiora bests the Sea God twice in a single game? Not me, that’s for sure. Alela Swift Commander 1x Alela, Artful Provocateur Creatures 1x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 1x Aphemia, the Cacophony 1x Archon of Sun&#39;s Grace 1x Daxos, Blessed by the Sun 1x Hanna, Ship&#39;s Navigator 1x Healer&#39;s Hawk 1x Luminous Broodmoth 1x Meteor Golem 1x Murderous Rider 1x Stonecoil Serpent 1x Tithe Taker 1x Transcendent Envoy Lands 1x Castle Vantress 1x Command Tower 1x Godless Shrine 1x Fabled Passage 1x Hallowed Fountain 2x Island 10x Plains 4x Swamp 1x Temple of Deceit 1x Temple of Enlightenment 1x Watery Grave Enchantments 1x All That Glitters 1x Angelic Gift 1x Banishing Light 1x Divine Visitation 1x Elspeth Conquers Death 1x Ethereal Absolution 1x Heliod&#39;s Punishment 1x Kiora Bests the Sea God 1x Mire&#39;s Grasp 1x Prison Realm 1x Smothering Tithe 1x Staggering Insight 1x The Birth of Meletis Instants 1x Didn&#39;t Say Please 1x Heartless Act 1x Neutralize 1x Unbreakable Formation Artifacts 1x Arcane Signet 1x Heraldic Banner 1x Midnight Clock 1x Traveler&#39;s Amulet Sorceries 1x Swallow Whole 1x Winged Words I Did Something Bad This deck is a powerhouse. While including all the control power Hanna’s Azorius shell was able to provide, stopping dangerous commander’s in their tracks with Prison Realm or Didn’t Say Please , and keeping such enchantment must-haves like Archon of Sun’s Grace , we’re able to create a solid board state before Alela even hits the board. Once she hits the board, the pace goes up to 11 as we start generating fliers at insane rates and just keep the fight in the air to close out the game. In a five-game run we went 4-1, but this loss was incredibly close and was mainly due to drawing nothing but lands for six straight turns. Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God was able to produce just enough flyers to keep us from lethal until finally dropping a Liliana, Dreadhorde General and making us sac our board. A beautiful fight. One ridiculous highlight I wish I caught on stream was the interaction between Kiora Bests the Sea God and Divine Visitation . It’s all fun and games until the 8/8 hexproof kraken you were counting on becomes a 4/4. Doh. All-in-all, this was the comeback of the month, showing the likes of Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy and Yarok, the Desecrated that there are commanders out there who can really utilize the enchantment theme with power and grace. Call It What You Want, but this truly has been The Best Day. Oh, and if you absolutely fall hard and fast for this deck? Don’t blame me. Alela is here to Stay Stay Stay. Enter The Guildhall &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Call it What You Want (Brawl)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/06/12/brawldt_3.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;outlaws&#39; merriment (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/rev%20your%20engines/2020/06/11/rye_3.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/5/d/5d7585ab-a364-471c-8ef1-318e459b4020.jpg?1572490798&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Outlaws&#39; Merriment (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I sit down in a local park to write my article for this week, the sun is shining bright, there’s a cool breeze complimenting the heat of a new summer, and everyone is outside enjoying our Phase 1 freedom. Life is good and it’s about time we celebrated! The Hexdrinkers are throwing the biggest party in Standard, and you’re all invited! So &lt;em&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/em&gt;, start your grills, and fill up your tankards: it’s time for the &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/eld/198/outlaws-merriment?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/5/d/5d7585ab-a364-471c-8ef1-318e459b4020.jpg?1572490798&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Outlaws’ Merriment &lt;/a&gt;! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Since we’re throwing the greatest rager of all time, we need a crowd to match. Outlaws’ Merriment gives us a new party-goer every turn. Some are a bit rowdy, some are those lovable, friendly drunks, and some are ready to start a fight the minute they show up. They all have one thing in common though: they’re ready to party. The excellent folk metal band Windrose once said, “Nobody is safe in a tavern full of drunken dwarves, no respect for humans, dragons, trolls, or pointy ears…” and that’s exactly what we’re aiming for during our Merriment! All these rough and tumble folk converging ensures scuffles, brawls, and general disorder, making this perfect for an aristocrats shell. A Real Motley Crew We’ll be relying on our outlaws to take one for the team, but they won’t be coming to the party alone. Corpse Knight will make sure that everyone who walks into our party does so with a bang (or more accurately, a ‘ping’). Corpsey’s partner in crime, Cruel Celebrant is also here to get us value on the way out when our outlaws fall in combat or are sacrificed, for the greater good, of course. Celebrant’s big sister, Judith, the Scourge Diva takes the brawl to the next level, making our bandits punch harder and sting even more when they get knocked out. With our constant generation of brawlers, we can attack and block as we please, all while dealing massive damage to our opponent. So far we’ve got humans, zombie, and vampires all joining our party. Let’s add goblins, giants, and more zombies to amp it up to 11! Our outlaws like to go fast and so does Dreadhorde Butcher . The more he gets in clean punches, the more powerful he becomes and he gives a hefty parting gift when he finally falls. Imagine a Butcher going down when we have Judith and Cruel Celebrant on the field, that’s three triggers straight to our opponent’s face! Legion Warboss always rolls up to a party with his whole posse. His token generation will supplement out Outlaws’ Merriment for ETB and death triggers and he also can get into the fray helping to Mentor the rookies who haven’t seen a tavern brawl before. Pulling up the rear is Bonecrusher Giant . He may not have much going on upstairs, but he sure can scrap. If you even so much as look at him the wrong way, he’ll stomp you. Last, but not least is the angriest, scrappiest, and most drunken dwarf in the whole of the tavern: Torbran, Thane of Red Fell . Everyone is going to be hitting A LOT harder when this guy enters the brawl. Perfect for knocking out our opponent. Top Me Off, Barkeep With all these brawlers about, people are bound to be falling left and right. We already have cards like Cruel Celebrant and Judith that benefit from this, so why not help facilitate a little more carnage. Bastion of Remembrance does everything we want for this deck. Making an additional token to get into the mix while draining our opponent for everyone for fall on our side is perfect. Weaponize the Monsters helps us take a proactive role. We can sacrifice our outlaws after blocking for extra value, pick off opposing fighters or planeswalkers, and even go straight to our opponent’s face. To help us get even more value out of our motley crew, Luminous Broodmoth lets them get back up for a second round and go over opposing brawlers.

We want our creatures to die and we want to get value off of it. Throw as many punches as possible and ping your opponents. The revel is swinging in full force and not worrying about any consequences. Life really is good y’all! Summer is just beginning and there are many more festivities to be had. And you can bet that Hexdrinkers is going to be hosting. Every. Single. Week. Stay brewing!

Back in the first few years of Magic’s lifespan, there were only a few releases a year. Wizards, as well as the player base were still falling into their stride. Now, any given year, there are three story sets, a core set, a commander product (or several), a masters set, and some other specialty product or innovation set, totaling thousands of new cards. If you’re looking to stand out and carve a niche, especially in older formats, you have to overcome a backlog of over 20,000 cards from a long and storied history of the game.&lt;/p&gt; Wizards has only gotten better at making more powerful and interesting cards, so on average, a card released now will fall by the wayside quickly. It can be even more rough if you’re a rare or mythic rare. With the rarity premium comes pressure to push boundaries either on rate or in design space. And oftentimes these don’t capture the hearts and minds of the players, or they were simply printed at the wrong time, crowded out by cards printed shortly before or after hand. Not Even a Bigger Boat Will Help Today, we’re talking about one such mythic rare: Impervious Greatwurm , the buy-a-box promo for Guilds of Ravnica. Nearly two years later, this absolute unit of an oversized frog snack has seen zero play. Let’s look a bit further, surely there’s some drastic downside that is keeping this Greatwurm from greatness. Based on the vanilla test alone, we’re already winning big. Looking back on those 20,000+ cards and 27 years of Magic, Impervious Greatwurm has the highest power and toughness of any creature, just beating out RtR’s Worldspine Wurm , and absolutely demolishing the original Ravnica’s Autochthon Wurm (what is it with the Selesnya Conclave and stupidly big wurms?). This thing is even bigger than Emrakul, the Aeons Torn , the original gold standard for “holy crap that thing is massive”. Stats aside, let’s read on. Impervious Greatwurm also has Convoke, a flagship mechanic of the Conclave that’s made appearances in many Ravnican sets, as well as some supplemental sets. Makes sense thematically, and at a CMC of 10, it’s nice that there’s a way to cheat a bit on the cost. But when it’s already so big, that reduction still seems unfair, especially if I’m using my mindset from when I first started playing and Siege Rhino was a god card. But that’s not all, there’s one more line of text on the Greatwurm. Hmm let me see here, “Indestructi-..”, HOLD ON WAIT, WHAT? You mean, not only is it the beefiest of boys, but I can cheat on its mana cost and it’s nearly impossible to get rid of? Someone tell me why, in the name of whatever god(s) you pray to, be it those of Theros, those of Amonkhet, or the Dragon God Nicol Bolas himself, this majestic beast has suffered such injustice?!?! With rotation coming in only a few months, we will make Impervious Greatwurm great again (okay, technically not ‘again’, but ‘for the first time’). I Get By With a Little Help From My Friends Luckily, when it comes to haymakers like the Greatwurm, we have built-in directions, as well as precedence, on how to call it into the fray. For the Selesnyans, strength comes in numbers and you’ll need a lot of poor suckers to wrangle the Greatwurm in. Convoking has been a solid strategy in the past for things such as Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis , Chord of Calling , and March of the Multitudes . That’s a good enough pedigree for us to try it. Standard is flush with token makers to help convoke. My personal favorites would be Raise the Alarm and Omen of the Sun for their rate and instant-speed versatility. Others like Rally for the Throne and March of the Multitudes, fueled by convoke and helping to fuel further convokes, could round out a token package. If you wanted to dip into red, Forbidden Friendship is the best upfront rate you’ll get, and Legion Warboss and Krenko, Tinstreet Kingpin provide recurring token generation. Whichever way you lean, don’t forget to sneak in a couple Emmara, Soul of the Accord ’s and Divine Visitation ’s for maximum value. Wurm Harvest So, convoking allows us to get a reduction on mana cost, but we’re still casting our Greatwurm. That’s way too slow and honest for me, so let’s just cheat him into play! Starting with the strategy’s namesake card, people have been Reanimating the most powerful of creatures since the early days of Magic. Reanimation isn’t as easy to come by as token generation, but there are enough powerful effects to fill out a necromantic package for our guest of honor. Pretty much all necromantic interaction stems from black’s portion of the color pie (with some splashes here or there) and it’s usually going to run you a cool five mana. My choice for best option however, is Back For More . Instant speed is an absolute killer as we can ambush and block, we’ll have pseudo haste, and the fight clause on top means we’re getting a three-for-one nearly every time. Next down the list would be Bond of Revival for the haste. The one thing better than suddenly returning the biggest thing imaginable to play, is your opponent having essentially zero time to deal with it. Blood for Bones is a whole turn or two earlier than other options, but it requires a tribute, as well as not granting extra triggers or keywords. Though, if we’re combining a token/convoke idea with reanimation, this would be a no-brainer. Unbreakable Bond is serviceable as that’s a lot of life we’ll be gaining. Once you’ve hit Cauldron’s Gift you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel, and, though interesting, the density of quality auras needed to make Rise to Glory a consistent two-for-one would stretch our deck thin. (quick shout-out to Elspeth Conquers Death which does have reanimation as its third chapter and is a powerhouse of removal and disruption on its front half) Of course, to fuel our reanimation strategy we’ll need ways to fill our graveyard. The two best options are discard effects or self-mill. Self-mill will put us at least in Golgari, maybe Sultai, depending on how deep we go. If you want a better look at what options there are, check out my Titan’s Nest article. The Binding of the Titans is strong in green, Tymaret Calls the Dead in black, and Merfolk Secretkeeper in blue, amongst others. Gyruda, Doom of Depths does the milling and the reanimating for us all in one, though it is on the higher end in terms of cost and commitment to an all-in strategy. Discard would likely employ red, making us Jund. Cathartic Reunion and Thirst for Meaning both turbo charge our graveyard. For a more in-depth discussion, check out my Offspring’s Revenge article. Money for Nuthin’ and Greatwurms for Free But reanimation is not the only way to cheat Impervious Greatwurm into play. Some cards allow us to forgo casting costs and utilizing other zones: move card directly from hand to field, pass GO, collect $200 and a 16/16 indestructible wurm. In older formats, Show and Tell , Sneak Attack , and Through the Breach have been putting Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Griselbrand directly into play for years, why can’t we have the same fun in Standard? Here is where the pickings start to get, not necessarily slim, but extremely conditional. If you like to roll the dice, activating a Dreamshaper Shaman or down-ticking a Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast is a viable path. Even spicier would be mutating an Auspicious Starrix or Illuna, Apex of Wishes . In all these cases, the deck-building would have to be precise, but you could make it so you hit an Impervious Greatwurm consistently. Most similar to the powerhouses of old are Purphoros, Bronze-Blooded and Ilharg, the Raze-Boar . Purphoros is basically a Sneak Attack on a stick, though having to sacrifice our monstrosity end of turn has always been problematic if we aren’t winning on the spot. Ilharg could be even better as it is a recur-able way to get the wurm into combat, and instead of sacrificing it, returns it to our hand, which sort of protects it. Still, both aren’t the most fool-proof ways to execute our gameplan. Lastly, if you want to play a more controlling game, Flood of Tears could be a lot of fun. Not only is it a great defensive card, but sometimes we’ll get to set down our Greatwurm and set up an offensive. Imagine all this with Teferi, Time Raveler ’s up-tick so you can Flood on the end of our opponent’s turn? Absolutely despicable and I love it. Annelid Aggression Now that I’ve gone on entirely too long about how to actually get Impervious Greatwurm into play, we need to discuss how to win. You might have noticed that one important word was missing from its textbox: trample. Not being able to bypass defenses means people can chump for days and potentially crack back or find an exile or bounce spell. That’s no bueno for us. We could give our Greatwurm a trample counter with Hornbash Mentor or Fully Grown though I doubt those would synergize with the rest of our deck no matter which way we took it. Cycling a Titanoth Rex could actually be beneficial if we were going for a reanimation strategy. T Rex isn’t as big as Greatwurm, but he’ll get the job done if we need him. Auras and equipment can also grant trample. Shadowspear is a versatile card and Setessan Training is cheap and fits the bill perfectly (and it helps make a case for Rise to Glory). Planeswalkers are always powerful inclusions to any deck and The Royal Scions or Vivien, Arkbow Ranger can give our wurm trample for the turn. Both seem to provide enough all-around utility to justify inclusion. There are also creatures who grant trample upon ETB, End-Raze Forerunners being the biggest and baddest. Since we’re already trying to cheapen our Greatwurm, I doubt we want to have to wait an extra turn and pay full price for these bigger tramplers, and if you’re invoking the End-Raze, you’re probably winning anyway. Now, all of these options are plausible, though some more efficient and less far-fetched than others. However, I’m saving what I feel to be the most fool-proof win condition for last. Why bother with trample (we didn’t even discuss unblockability, but trust me that’s an even more convoluted road) when we can go straight to the opponent’s dome? Allow me to introduce a humble two mana red sorcery: Fling . Yes, that’s what this has come to. After all that grandstanding about Impervious Greatwurm getting more love and recognition, we’re sacrificing him for the greater good, martyred for the sake of us climbing the ladder. And that, my friends, is a metaphor, or maybe an actual example of how life isn’t fair. Here’s a build that I put together utilizing the discussion in this article while pushing the envelope even further.

It’s situations like these that we live for here at Hexdrinkers; ignoring the norm and blazing paths in the face of the unknown (I’ve been reading Brandon Sanderson recently, cut me some slack for my bombast). These changes don’t kill all the top-tier decks, and many might flock to the safer tried-and-true strategies emerging from their Companion Winter hibernation, but we at Hexdrinkers like to keep looking forward. A shakeup like this provides opportunities to get wild before things settle into place. Without further adieu, welcome to a two-for-one edition of Homebrewed. You Know I Keep That Thang On Me Creatures 4x Acclaimed Contender 3x Dalakos, Crafter of Wonders 4x Fervent Champion 4x Renowned Weaponsmith 4x Stonecoil Serpent 4x Stormfist Crusader 3x Syr Gwyn, Hero of Ashvale Artifacts 2x Colossus Hammer 4x Embercleave 3x Shadowspear 2x Steelclaw Lance Lands 3x Blood Crypt 2x Fabled Passage 1x Godless Shrine 1x Hallowed Fountain 1x Island 2x Mountain 1x Plains 1x Sacred Foundry 3x Steam Vents 2x Swamp 4x Tournament Grounds 2x Watery Grave This deck originally started with me wanting to do something silly with Colossus Hammer . But looking further into the cardpool, there are some interesting and powerful cards pertaining to equipment in the format. Let’s start by discussing with the actual equipment we’ll be using to pound our opponent’s face in. Tools of the Trade Our armory only consists of four different cards, but they all serve an important purpose. Steelclaw Lance is the blue collar equipment for our deck, but it’s rate as well as sizeable buff means combat is going to be in our favor. Its (much) bigger brother, Colossus Hammer , is arguably a meme cards, but that doesn’t mean it’s gonna stop me from trying to suit somebody up with this and go to town (in all honesty it makes me more likely to do that). It, along with the proven powerhouse, Embercleave , are our best ways of taking our opponent from 20 to zero. To combat any retaliation and wrought divine wrath, we have Shadowspear to cover our bases. Though it’s seen mostly sideboard play since it escaped from the underworld, don’t underestimate it. Between being incredibly cheap to cast and equip and for an aggressive deck like this and giving a creature trample and lifelink to punch through damage while helping us outpace other aggro strategies really helps this gem shine. The anti-hexproof/indestructible ability doesn’t come into play often, but every once in a while it’s clutch, which is just icing on the cake. So those are the knives we’re bringing to the standard gunfight. Now let’s discuss choosing who will fulfill the prophecy and pull them from the sacred stones. We’re the Knights of the Round Table, We Equip When’re We’re Able In order to secure our kingdom, we’ve brought together several powerful knights who curve nicely into each other for a brutal offense. Leading the charge is Fervent Champion . A staple in mono-red decks since their release goes about as fast as you can go. And once multiple attack together the threat level increases even further. However, Fervent Champion has another clause that most people either ignore or don’t even know about: “Equip abilities that target Fervent Champion cost three generic less to activate.” Full stop. That means that cards like Steelclaw Lance, Shadowspear, and an Embercleave that needs to be moved over all equip for free (oh, and that’s also a big chunk off equipping Colossus Hammer)… … all of which we can grab with Acclaimed Contender . I suppose we can’t have anything on the rate of Goblin Ringleader these days, but we’ll take the Contender as they can grab us either another body or an equipment, if our board is in good shape. A full playset of these will help us sift through our deck at a quicker clip and keep the pressure on. But I did say we were curving nicely, so don’t think I forgot the two-drop slot. To compliment Acclaimed Contender’s digging we have Stormfist Crusader as continual source of card draw, impressive in a Mardu tribe (Note: not exactly known for drawing cards). Plus, a 2/2 menace for two ain’t too shabby. Sure our opponent also draws a card, but they’re taking damage and they sure aren’t going to outrace us. Recently brainwashed and conscripted by the evil forces of Rakdos Sacrifice, let’s bring this defender of the realm back to the side of justice. Lastly, commanding our forces is the majestic, Syr Gwyn, Hero of Ashvale . Though once a hero, but she’s been forced to take an early retirement. Not even Brawl players have taken to this card (probably due to the fact that it costs six, c’mon Wizards you could’ve pushed this card a bit as opposed to so many others), so it’s up to us here at Hexdrinkers to find Syr Gwyn a home (nudge nudge Chev, get on it). Once we can get her onto the field, the Hero of Ashvale is an absolute beast with sizable stats and excellent keywords. Even more importantly she gives us free equips (the Colossus Hammer dream shines a bit brighter) and more card advantage, which is crucial to push a deck like this across the finish line. Rise, and become a Hero once more in our crusade upon a new Standard format! That’s a capable and sizable army that we’ve recruited, but every army needs support staff; medics, squires, and most importantly, blacksmiths, all round out a successful war effort. Our forces are no different. Manning the forges today are two masters of their craft. So many equipment through the years just weren’t viable due to a high mana cost, high equip cost or a combination of both, but no longer. With Dalakos, Crafter of Wonders and Renowned Weaponsmith , we can expedite the forging and fitting of our steel. Dalakos also must put a little extra spice into his blades giving those who wield them the ability to zoom into the sky providing much needed evasion and speed; he gives them flying and haste. Begrudgingly, ‘flaste’ doesn’t sound as good as ‘flample’ (flying+trample). But how else are these knights suppose to slay dragons? In addition to weapons, our craftsmen have whipped up something a little more sentient and just as deadly. Stonecoil Serpent can be fueled by both Dalakos and R.W., growing to preposterous sizes, and can hold back flyers and multicolored threats all day (looking at you Dream Trawler ). Another welcome addition to the front lines. That’s the deck, a nice twist on an aggro deck incorporating a recently overlooked tribe and card type. In this new standard aggro decks will be especially potent, so this deck is an out of the box to approach the format. But if you thought that’s all for today, you’re mistaken good friends. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I only gave you one option, so I’ve prepared another deck with not Eldraine at its core, but Theros! This one is another aggro deck because there’s something cathartic about hitting “All Attack” on Arena. Zero to Hero Artifacts 3x Embercleave Creatures 2x Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice 3x Hero of the Games 3x Hero of the Nyxborn 4x Hero of the Pride 1x Heroes of the Revel 4x Hero of the Winds Enchantments 1x Conclave Tribunal 2x Omen of the Sun Instants 3x Fight as One 3x Gods Willing 2x Unbreakable Formation 4x Raise the Alarm Sorceries 2x Forbidden Friendship 2x Swallow Whole Lands 2x Castle Ardenvale 2x Castle Embereth 6x Mountain 9x Plains 4x Sacred Foundry Theros Beyond Death had this series of ‘Hero’ cards that made one helluva Boros aggro deck in draft. With all the auras in the set you could suit up a Hero and what I’d like to dub the ‘Hero Clause’ (a nod to original Theros’s ‘Heroic’ mechanic) kicks in buffing your whole team. It’s like in any superhero movie where at the edge of defeat, the leader of {insert your favorite named assemblage of superheroes} gives their rousing speech about not giving up and the power of friendship and working together and every gets their energy back plus more to defeat the baddies. Or maybe that was the plot of every Shounen anime ever… Anyway! I thought, why assemble the greatest version of this draft deck ever made and take a whole legion of heroes to war in Standard. And you know how it goes over here at Hexdrinkers, once that thought takes shape, we have to deliver it to y’all, fully fleshed out. With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility Our creature suite is very streamlined as they’re almost all Heroes. This means they’re a red or white creature that has the Hero Clause: whenever you cast a spell that targets this creature, creatures you control get +1/+0. Wizards has conveniently printed a bevy of heroes for us that curve out nicely. Hero of the Pride , into Hero of the Nyxborn / Hero of the Games , into Hero of the Winds , into Heroes of the Revel ? Yes please. And every great Hero has a sidekick (or several). We are no different, so we want a lot of buddies for our heroes. Heroes of the Revel and Hero of the Nyxborn already provide us an extra body apiece. We’re also running Raise the Alarm , Forbidden Friendship , and Omen of the Sun . Each provides a great ratio of mana invested to bodies and instant speed lets us ambush as well as set up a sneak attack. Lastly, we need ways to target our Heroes so we can beef up our team. Gods Willing is a great way to blank removal spells, win stalemates in combat, or even potentially sneak past blocks. Fight as One protects and buffs our creatures and we have a good balance of human and non-humans so we can utilize both modes. Swallow Whole is a sneaky pick as not only does it remove dangers across the battlefield (and synergizing with our token generation; tapping a creature isn’t a downside when you have so many), but it also targets our creatures so we can buff them! Double whammy, baby. Round out the deck with some extra punch in Embercleave , some protection in Unbreakable Formation , and a battle-hardened general, Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice and you’re ready to bring peace and order to the multiverse! Brave New World The recent bannings and rules change have shaken up many formats, especially Standard. The format has been busted wide open in the chaos. It’s time to try new things, have fun brewing, and of course, smash face. That’s it for this installment of Homebrewed!

I promised y’all last time that we’d play this cycling deck, so let’s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt; This deck is swift as a coursing river and packs all the force of a great typhoon (not a shark typhoon though, that doesn’t cycle for one mana). It also has all the strength of a raging fire, but dammit it’s not mysterious as the dark side of the moon! It’s basic and trash. And so am I. Real talk this deck is dumb, but it’s fun to play and that’s all that matters. If you’re drinking with this deck, please relegate yourself to a Truly (an inferior seltzer to White Claw) or Natty Light (which might just be water), you don’t deserve any better. Editor’s Note: Chev here, this deck brought Julian to Platinum so don’t listen to a word he says.

Now, I know I said I would do whatever the winner of our poll was but…as of writing, it’s tied. I’ll give that another week to simmer and instead celebrate the release of a new legendary creature to our fair format, courtesy of this month’s Brawl Guildhall! Give it up forrrrrrrrr Hanna, Ship’s Navigator!&lt;/p&gt; Originally appearing in Invasion, Hanna has a long legacy with the game in both lore and Brawl’s big brother Commander. For you more enfranchised players, I can already see your grins widening at the notion of repeatable graveyard recursion. One only needs to glance at her EDHRec Page to see the potential of constantly having access to a Seal of Cleansing , Cataclysmic Gearhulk , or even nastier. Most Hanna builds are controlling, limiting opponents’ resources while you build up a pillow fort. The ability to bring back threats like Wurmcoil Engine over and over again…well that’s generally icing on the cake. So what happens when you try to port a similar strategy to Brawl? Hit me Baby One More Time Hanna’s power is going to come from her flexibility in getting whatever piece of tech you need at the current moment from the yard. Need to make a substantial threat for an easy 5 mana? One activation and an All that Glitters got you covered. Need protection? How about reanimating an Alseid of Life’s Bounty ? Be they your Banishing Light or Staggering Insight , having access to your best pieces over and over again is incredibly powerful. While we will be recurring a few deadly artifacts like Meteor Golem and Crystalline Giant , our main focus will be on enchantments since TBD has such an incredible amount of support for that theme. So, what enchantments benefit the most coming back from the yard? An Enchanted Return Ashiok’s Erasure is probably not what comes to anyone’s mind when they think “counter spell”. It’s four mana, doesn’t fully destroy the spell, and feels a little clunky. I mean it’s an Oblivion Ring for spells. However, as we found out in our previous build (see link below), not only are the Oblivion Rings and Heliod’s Punishment of the format better than we gave them credit for, not a lot of people are running artifact or enchantment removal. So now we’re talking about a card that will exile a potential threat and hey if this gets axed, we can do it again! I’m actually not sure if this is worth including over another counterspell, so if you’re looking for things to tweak this is a fair target. However, in honor of our commander I feel there is a significant thematic boost to including this wild card. Shark Typhoon is really a perfect example of a Hanna target. If Shark Typhoon is played as an enchantment your opponent can relive the terror (cheesy, but terror nonetheless) of Sharknado. If you just need a really big flying shark (and really who doesn’t), cycle it and prepare to bring it back with Hanna. All Sharks all the time. The Birth of Meletis highlights another key category of cards in our deck: sagas. These enchantments have a limited lifespan, meaning as soon as Hanna is ready we’ll have the ability to start them right over. Coming in at two mana, The Birth of Meletis is certainly the cheapest Saga we have and most likely to be replayed in a consistent fashion. Searching for a land, creating bodies, and gaining a little life is a consistent set of abilities that can’t win on their own…but certainly provide the grease in our recursion machine to keep us in longer games. Banishing Light has all the same talking points as Ashiok’s Erasure. It removes a threat from the board and can be a potential target for Hanna if it ends up in the graveyard. Brawl is a format of big monsters, and removal always comes at a premium. Not much more to say about this powerhouse besides it’s an effect we’re quadrupling up on between Conclave Tribunal , Heliod’s Punishment , and Prison Realm . Junk Diving Moving on to potential artifact targets, we don’t have many but each fills a very necessary slot for any Brawl deck. We have: graveyard hate, removal, and terrifying threats. What more could you ask for?! Nothing. This is perfect and I love them all. Soul-Guide Lantern fills a familiar role to anyone who’s seen our Brawl builds before: hating on those nasty graveyards. All graveyard strategies are bogus unless we’re the ones currently using it and being able to target a sneaky Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath or Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger is an incredible benefit. Get out of here with your shenanigans. Also, in a build like this one we might actually be able to use the Lantern’s second mode and use it to draw the occasional card or two. I doubt you’ll be able to create an endless cycle, but it’s nice to know you have the option. Meteor Golem will obliterate anything. No questions asked. Best case, your opponent takes out their vengeance on it’s relatively minor 3/3 body or you can chump, putting Meteor Golem right into the graveyard for Hanna to pick up. Crystalline Giant is just a rude card. Slowly building up into an absolute beast or maybe trading as soon as it gets deathtouch. Either way, I’d expect this to be brought back multiple times a game. Other Notable Set Pieces Outside of recursion targets, our deck needs a few other powerful payoff cards to build up to. We can’t just rely on our removal and disruption because… well, that’s no fun. We’re playing Brawl, we’re here to fight and take names. So that being said, meet the opponent-might-concede bombs we’re packing. Dance of the Manse is our other big payoff for filling the yard with artifacts and enchantments. Unlike Hanna, Dance brings them all back directly to the battlefield. baBOOM! That’s right, we’ll flood the board with used removal, sagas, and one or two artifacts that have the chance to also become an army of 4/4s. Come at us. It should also be noted that any auras returned with Dance like Heliod’s Punishment or Ichthyomorphosis can get around some pesky punk with hexproof. I don’t see this being a big thing, but it’s worth pointing out! Out-tech your opponents! Anyway, I see Dance as the be-all finisher card that the rest of your deck spends the game preparing to cast. Cavalier of Dawn serves as another piece of non-conditional removal, maybe giving our opponent a 3/3 golem or…remember a couple turns ago when you used Banishing Light on their commander? Commander’s back in the zone, and your enchantment is just sitting on the battlefield with nothing to do. So target that, get a 3/3 Golem for yourself and the ability to exile something else in a couple turns! The most excellent of value. It’s almost too good with the added death trigger allowing you to bring something back to your hand for free. This is easily one of my favorite cards in the deck when played right. Kiora Bests the Sea God needs no write-up or speech convincing you why you should include it. 8/8 Hexproof Threat, Tap everything down, and if they’re not dead by then…steal their commander. This will end games, and if it doesn’t, I’m pretty sure your opponent won’t want to stick around for round two. So that’s it! Let’s see what this deck can get up to! Hanna, Ship&#39;s Navigator Enchantments Creatures 1x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 1x Arcanist&#39;s Owl 1x Callaphe, Beloved of the Sea 1x Cavalier of Dawn 1x Crystalline Giant 1x Meteor Golem 1x Starfield Mystic 1x Transcendent Envoy Lands 1x Command Tower 1x Emergence Zone 1x Fabled Passage 1x Hallowed Fountain 10x Island 11x Plains 1x Temple of Enlightenment 1x Tranquil Cove Sorceries 1x Bond of Insight 1x Dance of the Manse 1x Swallow Whole Planeswalkers 1x Kasmina, Enigmatic Mentor Enchantments 1x All That Glitters 1x Ashiok&#39;s Erasure 1x Banishing Light 1x Conclave Tribunal 1x Elspeth Conquers Death 1x Heliod&#39;s Punishment 1x Ichthyomorphosis 1x Kiora Bests the Sea God 1x Mirrormade 1x Omen of the Sea 1x Prison Realm 1x Shark Typhoon 1x Staggering Insight 1x The Birth of Meletis Instants 1x Dovin&#39;s Veto 1x Keep Safe 1x Neutralize 1x Thirst For Meaning Artifacts 1x Arcane Signet 1x Soul-Guide Lantern Conclusions For better or worse, the game has evolved since Hanna first came on the scene. What seems like a pretty powerful ability at first glance may not be as strong as you thought it was. For starters, Hanna needs to see untap before she can even get to her recursion shenanigans and most often commanders are either killed on sight, or countered (which is even worse when it’s Tale’s End ). Then, her ability can only be activated once per turn without significant help and you’ll still need to cast whatever you get back. Compared to the likes of Muldrotha, the Gravetide , this seems incredibly too slow in 1v1. It also makes everything that does provide immediate value, through ETBs or being a blocker, far more enticing to cast each turn. Why play a 1/2 that can do something next turn when I can drop a Crystalline Giant that will upgrade on the turn I play it? This deck went 4-1, but on only one of those wins was Hanna even a factor. Most of the time it was the UW shell that beat our opponents down long enough to either draw a threat or until they concede having no more threats to play. In fact, our one loss came from looking down the barrel of a more modern artifact/enchantment commander who was able to provide utility immediately to her growing army: Alela, Artful Provocateur . Losing the ability to bring back a couple enchantments per game is made up for in spades with access to black and generating a flying army of fairies that slowly prick you to death. Hanna just couldn’t keep up. Two games were won in part by Crystalline Giant with an All That Glitters , either by becoming an 11/11 flyer with first strike and deathtouch or an…11/11 flyer with first strike and a very lucky Kiora bests the sea god tapping all their creatures. I will give a special highlight to the final game, the one where Hanna actually came out to whoop some ass. It was against Snapdax, Apex of the Hunt and we had set up this beautiful board of Hanna, The Birth of Meletis , and a couple removal spells systematically taking down each potential Snapdax mutate target. Once our Elspeth Conquers Death hit the graveyard and was targeted by a Hanna activation the opponent scooped fearing the constant loop of being conquered ad nauseum. Woohoo! I think Elspeth would be proud of that one. So overall, this was a good build of UW Enchantment Control that was able to successfully limit the threats of our opponents until we could come up with a win con. While it’s not what I’m typically looking for, it was a lot of fun to play. Hanna kind of served as a nice bonus when she worked, but overall it feels like magic has passed her by. Hopefully she sees a powerful reboot much like the rest of the Weatherlight crew! So until next time!

Legendary heroes battling for supremacy using their might and wisdom and general badassery? Sit down, grab a drink. It’s time to learn about Brawl.&lt;/p&gt; No, not that one. Get outta here, this is a Magic site. We’re talking Brawl the format (although I’d completely understand if more of you were familiar with the former.) My love for Brawl started at the Dominaria prerelease. It was just after the format was introduced and Dominaria was built for Brawl on a fundamental level. Each pack had a dedicated legendary slot, and the prerelease box came with an extra date-stamped legendary. Originally, I had chalked up Brawl as a one-off way for Wizards to bring the Commander community into the rotating Standard environment and saw Brawl support just as a way to level up some of my 99-card decks…but as I flipped through those six packs of cards, my mind just started forming connections. A limited cardpool lacking “staples” can breed creativity. I found myself drowning in potential options and was mentally sorting cards into build categories for at least half the deck construction time and spent the rest of the prerelease scheming potential decks in the back of my head. I’m going to pretend that the preoccupation with potential Brawl builds is why I walked away from the event without a win to my name. But who cares!!! I knew exactly what I needed to structure a Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive deck OR how I planned to trade my friend Harrison for his Josu Vess, Lich Knight to aide Aryel, Knight of Windgrace in knight tribal. After leaving the event, I spent the entire walk home trying to convince my friends to give Brawl a shot. Considering half of them had never even played Magic before that day, I knew I might be facing an uphill battle…but the resistance never came. Maybe it’s the casual nature of multiplayer magic where all four of us could just sit down with a beer or two after a day of class and sling spells at each other. It could also have been the powerful narrative of choosing a specialized general to lead your troops into battle. Either way we all agreed to give it a shot. I was ecstatic. I met all these guys while studying abroad in New Zealand that semester, so even those of us who had some experience with the game were in a position where no one had any collection of cards to fall back on. Initially, we all just had those prerelease packs. This was incredibly fortunate for the budding playgroup to start on such equal footing, and allowed us to really experiment with combos of cards that otherwise would have seemed ridiculous. Eventually we found a local game store that would give draft chaff to students for free, and maybe we bought a pack or two…but singles were pretty much out of the question. I felt such a strong connection to when my friends back home and I had just started playing in High School. Both metas were defined by low-powered decks with one or two mid-tier rares that were absolutely devastating when dropped. Things like Helm of the Host or Siege-Gang Commander were among the biggest game-ending threats if they were allowed to get out of hand. Luckily this time around, everyone was able to skip the stage of only playing the coolest threats without any answers. If I were to list my all-time favorite Magic memories, that semester in New Zealand playing with low-powered brawl decks would easily be in the top three. It was really a testament to what crafty strategies we could build from the limited pool we had. To give an example of one of my sweetest creations, here is a selection from my Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive deck that’s still one of my favorite builds to this day. Any equipment that gave just a boost to power was an instant include, making my wild army of blue 2/1s into actual threats (as long as Tetsuko was on the field), and Champion of Wits served as a sweet piece of late game tech to loot away any nasty lands while serving as a reasonable body in the early game. Considering how fragile my army was, there were also a fair number of counterspells like Unwind or Wizard’s retort , much to everyone else’s chagrin. Hey! Man’s gotta protect his army of ninjas, am I right?! The group eventually coalesced around Darigaaz, Reincarnated , Hallar, the Fire Fletcher , Slimefoot, the Stowaway , and Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive . We’d all gather round a booth in the lobby of our student housing with maybe a beer or soda from the machine and spend the night laughing at the absurdity of being slowly whittled down by a Graven Abomination until someone could draw an Abrade . Then, maybe we’d go down to Burger Fuel for a bite or end up doing a bit of group studying. It was the perfect pressure release and a time dedicated to seeing friends amongst everyone’s busy schedules. After that initial Dominaria hype, the community’s love for Brawl also drastically declined. There were a few powerhouse cards that needed to be banned, (see: Baral, Chief of Compliance ) and Wizards had only pushed Brawl for that one set so support was severely lacking in Core 19 and Guilds of Ravnica. Sure, there were legendary creatures, but no excitement from the Mothership to spur innovative design in the format. I think one of the final nails in that early coffin was fall rotation, when all the commander players realized why a lot of them had drifted away from rotating formats in the first place…half their deck was no longer usable. But like all good things, eventually it came to an end. When I returned home, I really struggled to get any of my “killer” brawl designs upgraded into the commander meta. All the strategy and unique designs I’d spent months crafting didn’t really hold a candle to the more powered-up strategies of a legacy cardbase, and I found myself not really wanting to tarnish the memories I had with particular standard cards in favor of pushing a deck out. Since I didn’t have a brawl group anymore my interest in the format really petered, and it seems I wasn’t alone. Official Support didn’t return until Eldraine over a year later. This time, with preconstructed Brawl decks to really spur momentum. Most demand for these products ended up going towards Commander since at that point the Brawl player base was around two people. New staples like Arcane Signet and Tome of Legends instantly started popping up on EDHRec, but besides a couple articles the lasting Brawl impact wasn’t there. I don’t think many people even considered these cards for Brawl at the time. Maybe you’d play a few precon games with friends, but then you’d immediately turn Chulane, Teller of Tales into a beastly 100 card monstrosity. It really took the introduction of Brawl into Arena shortly after to give the format the jump it needed. Giving Commander players (and a budding Brawl community) a version of their favorite format online was an incredible selling point, and even though Wizards started small (only weekly events and some special occasions to play), the numbers wanting to line up behind their favorite legendary and throw hands only grew. That of course brings us to the present day. Now, Arena is only increasing its Brawl offerings from weekly queues to month-long events that give incredibly powerful legendaries from sets past their turn to completely rock the metagame. Stagnation is no longer something to associate with Brawl. Finally, two years after I dropped Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive for the first time, Brawl is getting the recognition it deserves. Alright I’m Hooked, What are the Specifics? Brawl’s official announcement from WOTC can be found here. TLDR: You build a 60 card singleton deck (the deck can only have one copy of each card besides basic lands), with one powerful legendary creature or planeswalker as your “commander” who starts outside the game. Think of this legendary character as the general of your forces. The best brawl decks build around the effects of their commander to create a synergy that benefits from constant access to your commander who starts essentially as an eighth card in hand. Also, being a singleton format you only ever need one copy of any given card. This becomes a huge boon when looking at MTGA’s wildcard structure. You don’t really want to be spending 4 wildcards on a playset of Breeding Pool s, right? Sure they’re cool but you’d rather save your redeems for Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath or Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy . It gives a lot more flexibility on how to spend your hard-earned wins when you don’t need to buy 4-ofs to be competitive. That should not dissuade enfranchised players though.The singleton nature of the format creates a landscape much harder to solve since it lacks the consistency of other 60-card formats. Finding ways to enact a successful game plan across multiple matches is an incredible puzzle to solve. Brawl’s Official Rules Unlike Commander, whose rules are handled by an external entity to Wizards, The Rules Committee, Wizards handles Brawl in-house and can provide the most in-depth description of the various mechanical specifics here. Brawl functions almost exactly like Commander, so if you’re a recent convert from Brawl’s big older brother the TLDR is your commander can be either a standard-legal legendary creature OR Planeswalker, and the starting life total for 1-on-1 is 25. It goes up to 30 for games of more than 2 people which I did not know…until I was doing research for this article. For those of you more unfamiliar with Commander… Your Commander is a Legendary Creature or Planeswalker who starts outside the game, meaning your initial deck is only 59 cards. All cards in your deck must fit into the color identity of your Commander. If your commander is a Simic creature, all spells in your deck must be blue, green, both, or colorless. The easy way to check this is if any other mana symbol outside of what’s on your commander shows up ANYWHERE on a card - you can’t use it. MTGA will also help and notify you of illegal cards if you choose one. Your first mulligan is free, so the first time you decide to shuffle your hand back into your deck - you draw seven cards again. After that, it follows normal London Mulligan rules Perhaps the biggest new concept is this idea of the “Command Zone” i.e. where your Commander starts the game. Basically, it’s a special place where you can cast your commander from any time you could cast them from your hand. The benefit is, any time your commander would be moved from one zone to another (battlefield to exile, graveyard to exile, hand to graveyard, etc.) …you can choose to have them sent BACK to the Command zone instead! Making sure you always have access to what is probably your greatest weapon. Now, this does come at a cost though: Each time your commander is sent back to the command zone, it’ll cost two more generic mana to cast the next time. This is called Commander Tax and balances some of the benefit of always having your commander accessible. Brewing Since Brawl is a much newer format than Commander, and due to the lack of content produced in 2019 until Eldraine about the format…there aren’t nearly as many resources available if you’re looking for ideas. Initially, EDHRec had an entire site dedicated to Brawl but as of right now that still hasn’t come back. Luckily, MTGGoldfish and a couple others can offer some ideas on what people are currently playing. I’d be careful starting with a net deck though! It can be difficult to make your own connections between cards after seeing something you might consider as “better.” Always scheme out your own idea first, maybe focusing on just cards already in your collection - and use these sites as ways to upgrade or add new things. Or, if you really just want to jump in at a competitive level all decks on MTGGoldfish are listed with their popularity in the current meta. Once you have a Commander in mind…Here are some tips that might help you on your journey to build the ultimate 60-card temple to badassitude. Your Commander should be built around: With the recent focus on legendary creatures to the benefit of both Commander and Brawl, there are a huge selection of generals to choose from - and your deck should hone in on what your commander does best. Goodstuff is a viable strategy, but generally building something that focuses on your Commander’s unique identity will benefit you even more. For example, recently I’ve started building a Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy deck to try out new stuff from Ikoria. Since Kinnan boosts the power of anything that isn’t a land tapping for mana by crazy amounts that was a big emphasis in my design process. Normally in Simic I wouldn’t think Chromatic Lantern , Heraldic Banner , or Midnight Clock necessary - but their added utility to make bonkers mana makes them stand out far more than normal. Another example is with Siona, Captain of the Pyleas . Hopefully you can tell Siona really wants to be in a deck with a high amount of auras and enchantments…but don’t forget that second clause of token generation! Maybe it’s not your main theme…but throwing in a Divine Visitation and maybe one or two other token generators might not be a bad use for a couple slots! Take notes of what cards you see other people playing: In a vein of “learn from your mistakes,” the brawl meta is so incredibly different from Standard that even if you’ve been playing standard for quite some time - cards are going to come up you had no idea existed. Maybe you’ve come up with a sick General Kudro of Drannith deck when someone drops a General’s Enforcer …Write that down! I hadn’t even considered Jiang Yanggu, Wildcrafter for my Kinnan deck until someone else turned their entire board into mana dorks that each tap for two and allowed their Kinnan to go off several times a turn! That game didn’t last long after… I’m also ashamed to admit that I had completely forgotten both Arcane Signet and Command Tower were in Arena until someone else played them. Actually, on that note…. Get Arcane Signet and Command Tower: You wouldn’t have gotten these in packs, but they’re so incredibly powerful and should probably go in every deck you make. Plus, they’re both commons and I cannot think of a more powerful impact that can be made by literally any other cards legal in the format. Get yourself some incredibly cheap mana fixing to offset the cost of buying/crafting a shock land. Take Rotation Into account: Brawl does have the same looming threat as Standard. Come Fall, how many of my cards will still be useful? This can be an incredibly annoying thought when first starting in the format but shouldn’t be something that you worry too much about. Apart from the occasional Historic Brawl event, maybe you do want to focus your efforts on including cards from Eldraine, Theros Beyond Death, and Ikoria. I will admit though, the sacrifice of one mythic wildcard for a Hydroid Krasis …is definitely one worth making. You still have like six months to enjoy its absurdity, and your deck would be better for it! Finally, watch streams! Like with any other format, you can learn a lot from watching other people play the Brawl decks they’ve meticulously created and care about - see synergies and ideas for their decks that you didn’t even think of. I suppose this is also the point where I should shamelessly plug our streams - where personally, I’ll be playing a fair bit of brawl in the coming days and hopefully this article will convince Julian to join in as well… Now go out, have fun, and let us know what you think! Enter The Guildhall &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;An Introduction to Brawl&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/05/28/brawl_primer.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;hello dawn, my old friend (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/homebrewed/2020/05/28/Zirda_combo.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/1/b/1bd8e61c-2ee8-4243-a848-7008810db8a0.jpg?1590710486&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Dawn, My Old Friend (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Homebrewed&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://wheelhouseworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TakeThis-1.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 75%;&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, a wise old man bequeathed this wisdom unto a young hero. Nowadays, these words could not be more true. If you have decided to venture into any format over the past month you probably noticed players bringing Companions to battle in record numbers. Powerhouses like Yorion, Sky Nomad , Keruga, the Macrosage , and Gyruda, Doom of Depths have dominated Standard, while much more sinister companions have reached into older formats. Lurrus of the Dream-Den has already gone so far as to have been banned in Legacy AND Vintage. (Note, Lurrus is the only card in Vintage banned for power level. Yeah.) With Companions being ubiquitous in Magic today (and what appears to be a sweeping ban announcement on the horizon), I decided to adopt the “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em” mindset and give a speculative final hurrah to one lucky Ikorian. Today’s Companion of choice is none of those I’ve mentioned above. However, it shares a spot with Lurrus as the only other Companion to have faced a ban so far: Zirda, the Dawnwaker . Like a Normal Fox, but Spicier Zirda is my personal favorite of all the companions. First, this fox is hella cute. If it wasn’t made of fire, I’d wanna be cuddling it pronto. Zirda also encourages activated abilities which I think are an underrated and underutilised part of magic. People want the instant gratification of an ETB, but properly building around activated abilities can accrue a crushing amount of advantage turn after turn. Lastly, Zirda is a Boros Commander who doesn’t care about the combat step.. okay maybe a little considered its own ability, but it doesn’t scream, “Attack Attack Attack” like an Aurelia, the Warleader or Tajic, Blade of the Legion . I like Wizards exploring design space outside of the red-zone for Boros, which is arguably the worst color pair in EDH. I love Commander and I might do a series on making Boros great again, but this article is about Standard, so let us (let me) refocus. As I said, Zirda, like Lurrus, has a banning under its belt. It was recently stricken from Legacy likely due to the prevalence of Grim Monolith and Basalt Monolith allowing for infinite mana, which tends to win games. Since we’re adhering to the motto of ‘joining’ not ‘beating’, infinite mana sounds like a good idea to me too! “But Julian,” you may be asking yourself, “surely if there was an easy way to go infinite in Standard, we would have already seen it!” The answer is elementary, my dear Watsons. There isn’t an easy way, but there is a way. Real talk, it took me a few whole days of research to put the combo of making infinite mana together and then another couple days to put together some ways to win with it. Zi’Rube’da Goldberg First let’s discuss the combo itself. Just like Zirda’s interaction with the monoliths, or looking to cards like Training Grounds , the key to generating infinite mana is a loop of tapping and untapping that will net you mana each iteration. The only card in Standard that allows this iterative ability of untapping is this uncommon gem from Core Set M20: Gauntlets of Light . Now, as much as the Hexdrinkers appreciates big butts, we only care about the second clause: the untap ability for two and a white. Three mana is a bit much to pay to untap though, luckily Zirda gives us a discount so we only need to pay one white mana to untap! But there are still a lot of unanswered questions… … like, where are we getting this white mana and what creatures are we untapping with it? Faeburrow Elder and Incubation Druid are two of the most versatile mana producers in standard. Not only can they produce any color you might need (and we are running four colors) but they both have the potential to tap for multiple mana. Faeburrow Elder taps for green and white just by itself and can add even more colors depending on what we have out. Incubation Druid can only get one color of mana at a time, but after it adapts it’s still a Gilded Lotus with legs, which is not shabby. Not to mention, Zirda’s static ability can give us an early adapt. So now we’ve assembled our combo. With Zirda and either Faeburrow Elder or an adapted Incubation Druid suited up with the Gauntlets of Light, we can tap for two or three (or four if we’re lucky) and then untap for a single white, netting us mana. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum. Excellent, we have as much mana as we could want in any combination of colors! Now what? Hulk Smash, Brush Wagg Almighty Brushwagg is a meme card, right? Wrong. The Brushwagg is the king of the Ikorian jungle and it is with his might that we shall conquer our enemies. You see, the Brushwagg may be small on the surface, but it hides untold power in the form of an activated ability pumping it into an absolute beater. With our combo we can have an arbitrarily (read, ‘infinitely’) large amount of mana which means we have an arbitrarily (read, ‘infinitely’) large Brushwagg. 20 life you say? The Brushwagg waits for no man, woman, or creature. With Ram Through , our Brushwagg can take the fight straight to our opponent by trampling through any poor excuse for a defense our opponent can muster with lethal damage. And this can all happen outside combat. The Brushwagg laughs at summoning sickness. And heavens forbid our opponent attempts to slay our Brushwagg, it can Fling itself, dragging them to hell with it. Where There’s a Wish, There’s a Way Now, some of you may have noticed the elephant in the room. Zirda, as a Companion, has a deck building restriction: all permanents in our starting deck must have activated abilities. Faeburrow Elder and Incubation Druid have their mana abilities. Brushwagg has its pump ability. But Gauntlets of Light… well, it gives the untap ability to the creature it enchants, so it doesn’t pass the test. But, as it is the linchpin of our combo, we need to find a loophole. What if, instead of it being in our starting deck, it were in our sideboard? That adheres to regulations. Now, we just have to retrieve it, and nobody does the job better than Fae of Wishes ! (people often forget they have an activated ability, but it comes in handy) Playing four Fae of Wishes to grab our Gauntlets from the sideboard may seem a little extra, but it’s necessary for the sake of the combo, which is admittedly extra in itself, but “you are what you brew” or however that saying goes. I did take this chance to utilize the sideboard a bit more and placed an additional copy of Fling and Ram Through there, as well as a Keep Safe to protect our combo and an Expansion//Explosion . Which, admittedly, is the best win condition for this deck, but I’ve lost to it enough that I have a grudge. Plus the Brushwagg is wayyyyyyy cooler. The rest of the deck is pretty straight forward. Shimmer of Possibility , Adventurous Impulse , and Incubation//Incongruity all find our combo pieces. Alseid of Life’s Bounty and Keep Safe protect our combo. Paradise Druid fixes our mana and wishes it was Faeburrow Elder or Incubation Druid. Definitely feel free to customize the sideboard with whatever silver bullets are appropriate, or just more redundancy. Admittedly, this deck is fragile. It’s built for finding our pieces consistently and quickly. Disruption is not our friend. Also, the one-of, or sideboard nature of our win conditions is a gamble that I had to take in order to make the deck run on all cylinders. Lastly, the manabase was hard to decide on since we’re playing four colors and our pieces are all over the spectrum. Luckily our dorks can fix our mana pretty good, so I’m not extremely concerned. Dawnest Before the Dark Companion Zirda, the Dawnwaker Creatures 4x Almighty Brushwagg 4x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 4x Fae of Wishes 4x Faeburrow Elder 4x Incubation Druid 4x Paradise Druid Instants 1x Fling 4x Incubation//Incongruity 1x Keep Safe 1x Ram Through Sorceries 4x Adventurous Impulse 3x Shimmer of Possibility Lands 1x Breeding Pool 2x Fabled Passage 6x Forest 2x Hallowed Fountain 2x Island 4x Ketria Triome 1x Plains 1x Sacred Foundry 1x Steam Vents 1x Stomping Ground 1x Temple Garden Sideboard 1x Expansion//Explosion 1x Fling 4x Gauntlets of Light 1x Keep Safe 1x Ram Through And that’s the deck! This one was a crazy puzzle to fit together and though I doubted its competitive viability, we did go 2-3! After getting beat down by super aggressive decks that went under us, getting that combo off for the first time was exhilarating. The second time was just as good because we fought our way through a Dream Trawler and TWO Agent of Treachery ’s. Ways to upgrade the deck would be better mana, though we didn’t really have any issues, and more consistent ways to find our pieces, though there aren’t really any tutors in Standard. Lastly, the only drink I recommend for this deck is one you’re comfortable pouring out for the looming loss of Zirda and all the Companions. Rev Your Engines will be returning soon with a real rager, so stay tuned, and stay brewing y’all!

Suit up your creatures with only the finest of fineries and then gracefully waltz into the chaos that is the combat step.

Messing with the graveyard, self-milling, and being generally tricksy is right up Sultai’s alley. Now we swing to the opposite end of the spectrum with the most straight forward wedge, Mardu: lovers of bloodshed, conflict, and the thrill of the kill. And what’s even better than a bunch of bloodthirsty berserkers charging their foes? A bunch of bloodthirsty berserkers riding into battle on spike-studded motorcycles, Mad Max style! Rev Your Engines my brethren, for we’ll be riding into the Standard battlefield eternal, shiny, and chrome with the might of &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/iko/198/offsprings-revenge?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/7/8/78619ffb-f514-4f9f-9d77-3ab49e045f7c.jpg?1586457085&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Offspring’s Revenge &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Offspring’s Revenge illustrates a tale as old as time: the maturation of an orphan into a bloodthirsty killing machine swearing to avenge their fallen parent. It reminds me of what Bambi could have been if Disney weren’t cowards, or maybe more accurately, a little known Japanese animation called Ringing Bell. It’s the tale of a sheep who goes on a quest to avenge his mother who was killed by a wolf, becoming a savage ram who has horns like spears and actually duels the wolf in the end. Highly recommended, but I digress. You know what could’ve helped out our woodland friends? An enter-the-battlefield trigger. Which is precisely what we’re looking for. Offspring’s Revenge is an excellent way to rebuy ETBs and attack triggers since it gives our vengeful babies haste. The glaring downside of the tokens being 1/1’s is no longer so much of an issue if we can maximize these two types of triggers to our advantage. I did a LOT of research for this article and let’s just say that there is a ridiculous number of creatures in standard with ETBs (and a fair amount with attack triggers too). Overcome with options and ideas, I figured we would have our cake and eat it too and I prepare a buffet of decks to choose from: A dedicated Offspring’s Revenge deck that’s extra hateful A take on a known standard deck, Mono-Black, utilizing Offspring’s Revenge , and A five color pile that pushes the boundaries of what we can reanimate (and the boundaries of functional deck building) Revenge is a Dish Best Served … Not cold. No, we want it flaming hot, so we’re serving up some burn. And the king of burn in this Standard format is the big three-headed dragon himself Drakuseth, Maw of flames . Drakuseth costs a fat seven mana, so instead of paying mana like an honest spellslinger let’s reanimate the big scaly bastard. Oh, and he has haste, so we’ll be dealing three and three and four, immediately. Drakuseth is great for gunning down our opponents creatures, whether that’s blockers, utility, or ones who’ll crack back at us. Drakuseth’s molten buddy tectonic giant is also joining the fray. It can go to our opponents dome on attack and is fine to be played out normally. Then, it can be recycled later after biting the dust for maximum value. Plus, the card advantage on tectonic giant ’s other attack trigger is underrated and recommended in games where your momentum is slowing. Like I mentioned earlier, the creatures we’re “reanimating” with Offspring’s Revenge are 1/1’s so we need a way to limit our opponents ability to go over us. One way to do that is if they don’t have any cards to play! (Yup, that math checks out - Chev) Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger and Basilica Bell Haunt both strip resources from our opponent and put us ahead on life totals. Like Tectonic Giant , both want to be run out early and then re-utilized later in the game. Kroxa especially, as it’ll put itself right in the graveyard for us. Keep in mind Kroxa will sacrifice itself if we get it with Offspring’s Revenge so escaping it can be favorable as well. Another way to maintain our onslaught is by blowing up our opponent’s stuff (duh, that’s like magic 101 Jules). Cavalier of Dawn and his friend Cavalier of Night are both happy to help. Dawn will pop any problematic noncreature permanents (say, a Teferi, Time Raveler ) and can easily tangle with the 3/3 left behind. Night will smite down any opposing fatties at the cost of one of our creatures, which we either want to recur anyway, or…. Is a 1/1 token that we already got a trigger off. Acceptable losses. Finally comes Plaguecrafter , a catch-all answer that can pick off a creature, planeswalker, or take another card out of our opponents hand. Also, since we’ll usually be sacrificing Plaguecrafter to his own trigger, he’s immediately ready for us to use again from the grave, similar to Kroxa. These are all great targets for our centerpiece enchantment, but most of these cards won’t get to the graveyard on their own! The gasoline to fuel our revengine (see what I did there?) comes in the form of classic red rummaging. Cathartic Reunion and Thrill of Possibility are both instant includes, filling our graveyard with targets and improving the consistency of our draws. Heartwarming Redemption is a one-sided pseudo- Windfall that I’ve been dying to try out (oh, that’s darkly ironic if you know the lore). Ox of Agonas is similar to redemption, just stapled to a body that can recur itself to provide extra gas late-game if we don’t have an Offspring’s Revenge . And you know what they say, you mess with the ox-spring, you get the flaming horns. And that’s pretty much the first version of this deck! Play card-draw spells to fill our yard and find revenges while stalling. Deal incidental damage with our smaller creatures until our more impactful ones touch down or their babies come for revenge. I’ve added some sweepers to ensure we don’t get totally run over with awkward draws. Some potential inclusions that caught my eye while building were Lotleth Giant , Angelic Guardian , and Underworld Sentinel . These can obviously be tweaked a bit depending on playstyle and this deck could probably use a bit more recursion, maybe something like a Corpse Churn just to provide more longevity. The build also doesn’t particularly like graveyard hate, but I haven’t seen Ashiok, Dream Render in a while and General Kudro of Drannith doesn’t seem to be seeing much play. The only drink that can pair perfectly with this manifestation of revenge is something that has aged just as finely. I recommend a barrel-aged beer such as Founders’ Dirty Bastard, a scotch style ale. Vroom Vroom, the Revengine Comes Enchantments 4x Offspring&#39;s Revenge Creatures 4x Basilica Bell-Haunt 2x Cavalier of Dawn 3x Cavalier of Night 4x Drakuseth, Maw of Flames 4x Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger 2x Ox of Agonas 3x Plaguecrafter Instants 2x Heartwarming Redemption 3x Thrill of Possibility Sorceries 4x Cathartic Reunion 3x Shatter the Sky Lands 4x Blood Crypt 4x Fabled Passage 4x Godless Shrine 3x Mountain 1x Plains 4x Sacred Foundry 3x Swamp All Black E’rythang Mono-Black has been a fairly powerful deck over the past few standard formats undergoing various transformations, but it’s recently fallen to the wayside. I think a little splash of blood and thunder is exactly what the deck needs to come back with a vengeance. Mono-Black is not a complicated deck. It wants to curve out; one-drop, two-drop, red-fish, blue-fish, Gray Merchant of Asphodel . My personal favorite sequence is Knight of the Ebon Legion , Yarok’s Fenlurker , Ayara, First of Locthwain , Nightmare Shepherd , and then of course… Gary. Gary is often the final nail in the coffin for opposing decks and mono-black likes to leverage him as much as possible. With the release of Theros Beyond Death, Nightmare shepherd was immediately slotted in to get additional Gary triggers. And now with Ikoria, we get Nightmare Shepherd copies five through eight with lots of upside in Offspring’s Revenge . Revenge give this linear deck options. Things are never truly dead and everything serves double duty. We’re running Cauldron Familiar / Witch’s Oven , because why not, and also Woe Strider . Both sac outlets just fuel our revenge when we need a boost. Besides getting a mini Gary to drain for a million, my personal favorite interaction is with Ayara, First of Locthwain . Every turn with offspring’s revenge out is a drain for one, a free block, and an extra card drawn. This deck’s shell is already pretty set, so after adding Offspring’s Revenge , the only real flex slots I had I gave to Lurrus of the Dream-Den because he gives us even more redundancy and he’s so prominent in every format nowadays. If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Some other potential choices are Rankle, Master of Pranks , Tymaret, Chosen From Death , or removal a la Murderous Rider . I recommend pairing something dark to drink with this deck. An Imperial stout such as Victory’s Storm King has a hefty weight to it and will warm up your icy soul. Or you could take a page out of our Queen Ayara’s playbook and settle with a dark, dry, red wine… or is that blood? Uh … n-nevermind. Not Even Light Can Escape the Blackhole of My Revenge Creatures 4x Ayara, First of Locthwain 4x Cauldron Familiar 4x Gray Merchant of Asphodel 4x Knight of the Ebon Legion 2x Lurrus of the Dream-Den 4x Nightmare Shepherd 4x Woe Strider 4x Yarok&#39;s Fenlurker Artifacts 4x Witch&#39;s Oven Enchantments 4x Offspring&#39;s Revenge Lands 4x Blood Crypt 4x Godless Shrine 10x Swamp 2x Temple of Malice 2x Temple of Silence 50 Shades of Revenge Standard right now is an absolute wonderland when it comes to mana. We have ridiculous color pair support from Return to Return to Ravnica block, complimented by the full set of temples finished in Theros Beyond Death. And we also have shard support and the triomes from Ikoria. Even Throne of Eldraine gave us a crucial mana fixer in Fabled Passage ! So, when the world is our oyster, why would we limit our revenge to merely three colors? Yes. I’m talking a full rainbow of revenge. As I mentioned earlier in the article, when I was researching for this article, I looked at any creature that we could recur, so any creature that has red, white, or black in it, but including any of the other colors. There are a lot of interesting and powerful creatures once you open up your color combos, and since I want to play all of them, this deck has a toolbox sensibility. We’re even using Yorion, Sky Nomad as our companion for value and as an excuse to run even more spice. It also means the mana is ridiculous, but we’ll take it for the few times we really go off. You probably get the gist of what’s up regarding Offspring’s Revenge by now, so I’ll just give you the decklist and you can see this monstrosity unfold for yourself. Also, drink whatever you want with this one, all rules and allegiances have been thrown out the window. Please forgive me for my sins. Vengeance in Technicolor Companion Yorion, Sky Nomad Creatures 3x Atris, Oracle of Half-Truths 2x Deputy of Detention 1x Drakuseth, Maw of Flames 4x Dream Trawler 3x Elite Guardmage 1x God-Eternal Bontu 2x Golgari Findbroker 4x Gravebreaker Lamia 1x Ilharg, the Raze-Boar 2x Knight of Autumn 2x Massacre Girl 2x Polukranos, Unchained 2x Rakdos, the Showstopper Instants 3x Thirst for Meaning Lands 4x Blood Crypt 2x Fabled Passage 4x Godless Shrine 2x Hallowed Fountain 4x Indatha Triome 1x Island 3x Ketria Triome 1x Mountain 1x Plains 4x Raugrin Triome 4x Savai Triome 1x Steam Vents 1x Swamp Enchantments 4x Fires of Invention 4x Offspring&#39;s Revenge Sorceries 4x Cathartic Reunion 2x Idyllic Tutor 3x Shatter the Sky That’s all for now folks! I had stupid amounts of fun brewing these deck and I think we’re only scratching the surface on Offspring’s Revenge ! During the brewing process I had ideas for a mono-red deck with a goblin theme, think Krenko, Tinstreet Kingpin , Goblin Ringleader , etc. or a Boros deck utilizing the life gain cores of past Standards ( Alseid of Life’s Bounty , Ajani’s Pridemate , Linden, the Steadfast Queen ) with beaters like Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice . Okay, I need to stop, y’all already got three lists in this article. But that’s the greatness of finding a sweet card to brew around; the possibilities are endless, but you want to find them all.! So, until next week, kick back, pop a cold one, and stay brewing y’all!

Don’t let him fool you&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of those we’re going to focus on brews that are relatively easy to put together with either some time in standard or a fair number of drafts under your belt. Let’s get right into it!&lt;/p&gt; Belle of the Brawl Today we’re going to start by going back in time three months. Before companions ruled the Earth…before Godzilla became an actual card. Before…Corona (and not the beer). It was a simpler time, my friend Oakley and I were getting our butts handed to us by a father and his nine year old son in a 2HG prerelease. (Actually come to think of it, I feel like a lot of my Brawl memories come from being trounced at prereleases…) Anyway the event was a bust, but I had opened a Siona, Captain of the Pyleas and had started imagining what a Selesnya commander deck would look like with her at the helm, leading an army of heavily auraed forces to victory against legions of foes. Pretty neat right? Not only are you getting value as soon as Siona hits the battlefield, being able to “tutor” for a useful aura but also enabling a token sub strategy is not a bad plan B. The cost of throwing an Intangible Virtue or an Anointed Procession into a 99-card deck isn’t too high and considering they’d also enable more enchantment shenanigans…anyway. Right now you’re probably thinking “Chev, come on. Everyone does commander deck techs. Give me that good good BRAWWWL!” And I’d say, “Hold on, eager reader, we’re getting there.” So I started scheming, and a plan started to form…way too quickly. You see, I couldn’t get my mind out of this rut that after needing to throw in the package of the most powerful auras ( Eldrazi Conscription , Darksteel Mutation , Gift of Immortality ), and the ramp package to be able to play the bigger auras and the consistency of a turn-two Siona… I found much less room for creativity than I would have liked. Some of this could be an amount of creative burnout being fresh off a stint of upgrading most of my other commander decks - maybe Siona was just schemed at the wrong time - but it gave me the glimmer of an idea that you’re about to see the results of. What about putting together a Selesnya aura brawl deck? The restricted cardpool could really be a boon to the creativity required, and enable us to have a more unique experience with oh captain our captain. Enough talk though, let’s tech. Offensive Line We’ve got a pretty impressive lineup available thanks to Theros’s heavy enchantment theme, and a couple powerful standouts from Ikoria and Eldraine. Let’s see the heaviest hitters: All that Glitters reminds me of my only foray into pauper using a build that centered around Slippery Bogle and Ethereal Armor . Unfortunately, trading first strike for growing off of artifacts is not really helpful for us here but being able to directly benefit from every aura and other enchantment we play is reason enough to include this. With any luck, the high number of other auras and enchantment creatures will let this serve as a cheaper copy of our next highlight… Colossification I mean damn, there’s not really much to be said for an aura that hands out +20/+20 besides I hope we can get it on something with trample. It’ll be interesting to see how often this is actually allowed to come down or put in work since the rest of our curve is relatively low. But in the event of a long game, having this big a finisher in your corner ain’t bad. Hydra’s Growth trades Colossification’s significant mana cost for a time investment, being able to easily reach and surpass +20/+20 in the more durable form of +1/+1 counters, but taking a few turns to get there. Hydra’s growth has been an absolute powerhouse in every limited deck I made during the THB season and it’ll be interesting to see how this shapes up in Brawl. I personally think it’ll become a kill on-sight card which is certainly nice to draw attention if we’ve got anything else we need a distraction from. Warbriar Blessing is one of our few forms of removal. White certainly doesn’t have the suite of cheap removal available to it in eternal formats, and besides a couple higher cost instants this might be one of the best chances to stay on theme and pop one of our opponent’s creatures. We’ll see if the benefits outweigh the costs though… But of course, what good are all-star auras without all-star targets to enchant? We need a strong creature base to support our theme and I think these guys have what it takes to go pro: Archon of Sun’s Grace could stand on its own as a 3/4 flyer with lifelink for 4 as a potential target to drop a Colossification on, but add on the Constellation trigger to create MORE flyers with lifelink? What?! It’s like…that’s our strategy or something! Anyway you’ll never be disappointed by drawing this card, at any point in the game. Paradise Druid is a great example of what I consider a long-term investment. Upfront, it can give you a lil mana, get you dropping threats early, but later….you’ve got a creature with conditional hexproof. While you still need to navigate around its loss of hexproof on tap, there’s a lot to be said for equipping Paradise Druid with Sentinel’s Eyes and any other enchantment in your deck to build your own hexproof threat. Just be careful and remember Colossification taps your creature, which would render Paradise Druid vulnerable for a turn. Lavabrink Venturer takes what makes Paradise Druid good and turns it to 11… conditionally. Remember that Protection also protects Lavabrink from your stuff so be incredibly careful about choosing Odd, since that’ll prevent it from being a target of either Colossification, Hydra’s Growth, or Sentinel’s Eyes. Just something to consider. Either way, still incredibly powerful if you have the wildcard to spend. Setessan Champion is what I’d call an undeniable team player. Regardless of who gets the aura you’re playing, Setessan Champion still gets a +1/+1 counter AND draws you a card. That’s some incredible value on a 3-drop, especially considering they’ll also trigger on any enchantment creature or other enchantment you’re playing. Green and White are not known for their card draw, so a repeatable draw engine that also plays along with our deck theme is something I’d even consider in a Siona commander build. Defense As much as I’d love to wage an all-out assault of auras, we do need to be prepared for the inevitable: our opponent will want to play creatures and stuff as much as we do. This is where the second type of aura in our deck comes in. Trapped in the Tower, while conditional, is really worth the two mana. It won’t be able to hit any form of Niv-Mizzet, but clamping down on an indestructible God or any other beast without wings is of incredible benefit. It also has the clause negating activated abilities which puts this over Pacifism in my book. Kenrith’s Transformation is the latest in a long line of such transformations that I had thought were supposed to be in Blue’s part of the color pie. It’s not as powerful as Song of the Dryads or Imprisoned in the Moon , but is still incredibly useful at stopping a threat. It even replaces itself! While testing the deck I did manage to cast this on Kenrith himself, so, that was a huge flavor win. Heliod’s Punishment sneaks in over Dreadful Apathy for a similar reason of Trapped in the Tower over pacifism: the stifling of annoying abilities. Does it have a four turn clock? Sure, but hopefully you’ll get something else by then. While Dreadful Apathy can deal with the threat more permanently at six mana, I’ll gladly take this trade. Especially when targeting a commander who they’d potentially be able to replay if it weren’t stuck on the battlefield. Non-Aura Removal We have several powerful reasons to utilize auras (mainly Siona), but sometimes we need to rid ourselves of a threat more permanently. That’s when we bring in the closers. Banishing Light is incredibly potent and the effect of triggering all the Constellation abilities as well as boosting All that glitters makes this a no brainer. For when trapping Chulane, teller of tales in a tower isn’t enough, try banishing it to the shadow realm. Calix, Destiny’s Hand works as a great enchantment engine, serving as a relatively repeatable mini Siona trigger. This is mostly upside though as his inclusion is frankly due to the power of his minus. Being able to repeatedly Oblivion Ring is no small feat, and having a second copy of Banishing light really helps with consistency. Also, if you’re playing any of the Theros Gods - putting a card underneath Heliod, Sun-Crowned is nigh unbreakable…unless you’re that one jerk I found running Barrier Breach . Swallow Whole might be the closest we get to a straight up Swords to Plowshares in Standard and I believe it should be recognized as such. There are hoops to go through, and it won’t be able to kill everything but having that ability at one mana and a creature will come in handy more often than not. Going Tall and Wide While we don’t plan to spend too much energy on Siona’s secondary ability, I do believe a few cards make their inclusion well justified, and help serve as a potential backup plan when all else fails. Commanding Presence doubles as a pretty powerful aura granting a boost and first strike, this can easily make a dent in defenses, but really shines when paired with the next highlighted card. Divine Visitation is one powerful card. Not only could you be getting an angel for every aura you play with Siona on the field, but even if they’re removed you still reap the benefits from both Commanding Presence, and the previously mentioned Archon of Sun’s Grace . Plenty of opportunities to fill the board with 4/4 angels by doing what you already planned on doing. Everything else included serves mostly to support these bigger themes or protect our investments. Things like Veil of Summer and Unbreakable Formation keep our creatures alive, while Starfield Mystic and Transcendent Envoy make our enchantments cheaper. There are also a couple more high power creatures like Questing Beast but these can really be substituted with whatever bonkers aura-targets you have lying around in a pinch. Here’s the final list! Siona, Captain of the Pyleas Auras Creatures 1x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 1x Archon of Sun&#39;s Grace 1x Destiny Spinner 1x Faeburrow Elder 1x Gilded Goose 1x Heliod, Sun-Crowned 1x Ilysian Caryatid 1x Knight of Autumn 1x Lavabrink Venturer 1x Luminous Broodmoth 1x Paradise Druid 1x Questing Beast 1x Setessan Champion 1x Starfield Mystic 1x Transcendent Envoy Lands 1x Blossoming Sands 1x Command Tower 1x Fabled Passage 9x Forest 9x Plains 1x Temple Garden 1x Temple of Plenty Enchantments 1x All that Glitters 1x Angelic Gift 1x Banishing Light 1x Colossification 1x Commanding Presence 1x Divine Visitation 1x Elspeth Conquers Death 1x Heliod&#39;s Punishment 1x Hydra&#39;s Growth 1x Kenrith&#39;s Transformation 1x New Horizons 1x Omen of the Hunt 1x Sentinel&#39;s Eyes 1x Trapped in the Tower 1x Warbriar Blessing 1x Wolfwillow Haven Instants 1x Karametra&#39;s Blessing 1x Unbreakable Formation 1x Veil of Summer Sorceries 1x Swallow Whole Planeswalkers 1x Calix, Destiny&#39;s Hand Results Out of the 7 matches we played with Siona, we went 5 and 2. Siona was able to successfully ramp and limit the threat of Niv Mizzet, Reborn and Kenrith, the Returned King quite easily with those defensive enchantments while also turning Paradise Druid into an absolute wrecking ball of All that Glitters and Sentinel’s Eyes in both games!! Others against Brokkos, Apex of Forever , Niv-Mizzet, Parun , and Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath followed similar trajectories being able to render an entire stack of mutated creatures inert while Brokkos was in the pile, or keeping Niv-MIzzet stuck to pinging as opposed to also being a flying 6/6. The two games lost partly involved Dreadful Apathy in place of Heliod’s Punishment . In the earlier build of this deck, I favored the more costly total removal over simply rendering a commander unuseable which proved useless against Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy . The second game we just got beat, the Winota, Joiner of Forces deck we were up against played fast and hard - in fact the player was so confident in their ability, they said good game as soon as they played Winota. What a champ. Overall, I think the deck has a lot of potential and is definitely something to play if you’re looking for a unique Brawl experience in the current meta. For a total of 12 Rares and 5 Mythics, you’re looking at a pretty consistent construction. Comparatively, That would get you half a manabase and one set of Uros in Standard! (also 2 of those rares are for Faeburrow Elder and Gilded Goose which could easily be swapped with Incubation Druid and Leafkin Druid if you’re on a budget) Enter The Guildhall &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Siona and the Argonauts (Brawl)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/05/14/brawldt_1.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;titan&#39;s nest (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/rev%20your%20engines/2020/05/11/rye_1.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/7/5/75d4e6f3-73cb-4799-bcb9-c1f5bc234a02.jpg?1586521298&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Titan&#39;s Nest (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every set Wizards teases us with these niche, often rare or mythic, enchantments, that just scream to be built around. These cards can be the core engines of decks that rack up mana and card advantage turn after turn to bury the opponent and allow for explosive kill turns…. or, often, they fall overlooked, misunderstood, and forgotten, unable to compete with the raw efficiency of modern card design.&lt;/p&gt; In Standard, you can look to Wilderness Reclamation and Fires of Invention (two of the best decks currently), but several other enchantments lay in wait in standard that haven’t quite seen their day. Cards like Underworld Breach and Doom Foretold had brief stints in the limelight, but gems like Firemind’s Research , Enigmatic Incarnation , or Happily Ever After (a man can dream, okay?) have seen love only on the fringes, if at all. Ikoria is no different, with a bevy of incredibly spicy and seemingly powerful enchantments. The ones I’m eyeing currently are the rare shard enchantments and we’re kicking off this series with a real doozey in Titan&#39;s Nest ! Welcome to Rev Your Engines, the series where we utilize unique engine enchantments to kick standard into high gear! Will we have a highly tuned engine to take us across the finish line or will we sputter and stall out? (I simultaneously hated and loved making those puns) A Wretched Hive of Scum and Villiany With the right build, Titan’s Nest falls firmly in the “busted” category and I think it could be a major player in standard once rotation comes in the fall. Just reading the card, we essentially give all our spells delve (a mechanic that has gotten cards banned in many formats). Yes, there are some restrictions, no X-spells, only mono-colored spells, but Hydroid Krasis and Expansion//Explosion are too mainstream anyway. Titan’s Nest is also full on Sultai (hooray for the return of wedge support), colors that happen to love putting milling themselves for all sorts of benefit. On the surface, this enchantment can turn our graveyard into a source of ramp to keep our foot on the gas in the mid to late game. But that’s boring. Like I said earlier, this enchantment should not be treated as a fair card, and I intend to use it solely for the forces of evil. And the dastardly villain who has made the Titan’s Nest his lair is none other than Syr Konrad, the Grim . We’re Dealing With a Real Maniac… Syr Konrad was a powerhouse in Throne of Eldraine limited, but in constructed formats he’s been generally overlooked. Some of that might be because he has more lines of text than War and Peace… or more likely because he was turned into an elk. TLDR, any time creatures are entering or leaving the graveyard, Syr Konrad is gonna ping our opponent. They want to wrath, they&#39;ll take a bunch of damage. They mill some of our beloved troops, they get pinged a few times. If creatures are banished to the shadow realm (whoops wrong card game) by Titan’s Nest to generate loads of colorless mana…. they take damage for Every. Single. One. That is our dastardly scheme in a nutshell: mill as much of our deck as possible, get a Syr Konrad and Titan’s Nest on the field and huck a putrid fireball from beyond the grave. Bring in the Minions So, what poor saps have been enlisted as Konrad’s minions to be sent to their inevitable unceremonious demise? Syr Konrad doesn’t discriminate. Merfolk, Bird, Gorgon… Wall? He’ll take every helping hand/fin/brick he can get. The common thread among this creature suite is that all these creatures mill us, fueling our Nest and triggering Konrad if he’s out. We’re looking at three to four cards binned per creature we play which adds up very quickly. While there are cards that could self-mill more efficiently in standard, we need a high density of creatures to enact our combo kill. These creatures all come with upside in that they pad our life total or block incredibly well. Gorging Vulture and Mire Triton both boost our life enough to get us that extra turn we need to assemble our combo. Venomous Hierophant and Mire Triton both have deathtouch which is a big deterrent, especially for larger creatures that will outclass our motley crew of recruits. Wall of Lost Thoughts and Merfolk Secretkeeper have big butts to hold back small creatures chipping in, and Glowspore Shaman often trades up. Also, we are not afraid to chump block or take an early trade! It only fuels us once it comes time to go off. Every Super Villian Needs Some Villianous Tools Our non-creature suite is trim, but supports and adds consistency to our gameplan. I like Tamiyo, Collector of Tales a lot. It’s a versatile card, especially with graveyard strategies. It can dig for our combo pieces, milling us more in the process, or regrow things that we milled earlier. We don’t want to dilute our creature count and at four mana, it’s on the higher end of our curve, but I thought trying one out could be interesting. Corpse churn , an Ikoria reprint, is an auto-include. It mills us and can grab a Syr Konrad we milled or just any other fallen soldier to keep the mill train rolling. Once again, this consistency and ability to maintain momentum is important for a combo deck like ours. The Binding of the Titans was a card that intrigued me at release, but never really found a home in any of my decks until now. Given, it takes some turns, but this card is a powerhouse for us. It mills us, it gains life and allows us to pick off a lurking Uro, Titan of Nature&#39;s Wrath or Lurrus of the Dream-Den target. Nice. In chapter three we even get to fix our mana or, like Corpse Churn, get back a creature we may need or our fearless leader, Syr Konrad. And then after all that, we can exile the Binding to our Titan’s Nest to play our other spells. Tymaret Calls the Dead as a one-of is just a catch-all slot. It mills more than our other cards, albeit over multiple turns, gains us some life at the end, and if you can exile an already spent Binding, we can get an additional blocker (or attacker if our opponent is playing a creature-light deck). The mana base is mostly basics, just to keep it simple. We want to be going as fast as possible, we cannot wait for tap lands. Add a few shocks and Fabled Passage s to fix and season to taste. The Scheme is Foolproof! The plan is simple, mill yourself as fast possible. Use as much or all of your mana every turn and get those cards in your graveyard. Always keep a track of how many creatures are in there so you know when you’ve reached critical mass. Also, keep track of where your Konrads and Nests are. We need those to win the game, so if you get a chance to nab one back from the yard, get it. As you’re playing your creatures out, block aggressively. We want to conserve our life total as best we can, and we lose nothing from an additional creature in the bin. Also, don’t be afraid to attack! Getting chip-ins is critical to lessening the threshold needed for Konrad to do his thing. Most of our creatures attack well, so get in there if it’s free. Unfortunately, this deck comes with some drawbacks, so let’s discuss what might endanger our victory. Like most combo decks, this deck is incredibly linear and there’s no real interaction for us besides blocking, so a counterspell can hinder us. Also, any sort of exile really hurts. Elspeth Conquers Death hits both our main pieces and something like Elspeth’s Nightmare is a nightmare for us as well wiping out all the progress we’ve made. Sometimes we just won’t draw Titan’s Nest and Syr Konrad, or we’ll mill them. Lastly, we realistically can’t deal much more than twenty damage, so any deck that has lots of life gain can be a problem. But these are issues that plague all but the most resilient of combo decks and they’re risks that we’ll take to play this ridiculous yet beautiful brew. On the flip-side, this deck is not a tier deck. Opponents won’t see their demise coming until it’s too late. And since our pseudo delve is a mana ability, they can’t stop it and we can do everything immediately at instant speed! There’s nothing like stacking up 20 Syr Konrad triggers up and letting them machine-gun down our bewildered opponent. If you ever go to play this deck yourself, I recommend cracking open a nice sour beer. Konrad is truly EVIL (&quot;Every Villian is Lemons&quot;) plotting in the Titan&#39;s Nest, and lemons are quite sour. Two of my favorites are Druthers&#39; Dare and Dogfish Head&#39;s Seaquench.

We’re incredibly excited to announce the launch of a brand new platform chock full of incredible Magic the Gathering content brought to you by some of the freshest voices in Magic. This is our first time doing anything of the sort, so we’re basically fresh off the boat.&lt;/p&gt; A Lil’ History Lesson Our playgroup was founded in 2015, narrowly avoiding a fate of Yu-Gi-Oh thanks to some quick thinking by the proprietor of a local game shop. Since then, Magic has become a way for us to stay together and continue to foster a friendship that has since endured through our college experiences and continues to develop as we enter into the professional world and our adult lives. What’s Our Angle? For us, Magic has always been a force inspiring unity. Spending each school break when we’re all together whipping out new and exciting builds for a night of Commander, drinking beer and swapping stories. Or driving across state lines to meet up for midnight prereleases. There are endless tales like this for us, as I’m sure there are for many of you.We want to share those experiences and memories with you and hear yours, all while toasting our favorite beverages. Countless outlets exist to get every type of Magic fix available. MTGGoldfish, MTGStocks, TCGPlayer, Scryfall, CoolStuffInc, and Hipsters of the Coast all provide great content. We enjoy serving up competitive analysis and meta discussion, but we also want to provide a window into how we experience magic and how it has been an outlet of creativity for us. We found that magic is not only a game, but a way to communicate. It could be explaining your incredibly convoluted and “totally tier 1” combo you assembled to your friends around the kitchen table, or just discussing all the hot spoilers that’ll slot into your commander decks around the campfire. These holistic experiences that most people would tell you are their favorite memories of the game should be shared with joy: and we want to bring that to all of you. Best Commanders to play during a night of drinking? How is crafting a deck like making Homebrew? Which of our decks have aged like fine wines and which went down the hatch quick like a shot of bottom tier vodka. Every game and every card has its own story. We’d love for you to join us in recanting this all. Grab a drink and shuffle up! Meet our Founders: Chev Eldrid - Having just completed a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Chev is eager to develop his skills in both software development and Magic content creation. He’ll be bringing you content on Brawl, Commander, and some streaming in the upcoming weeks with a couple series soon to be announced. Chev is probably also responsible for anything broken on the site so he’s the person to contact for that. Julian Leal - A recent graduate of the University of Maryland, Julian has spent the last year developing his professional career as a Geologist. Though he’s most at home playing Commander, Julian has also spent this time striving to branch into all other constructed formats and brewing around anything and everything. Expect brews and competitive decks in Standard, a delve into Historic, and the occasional foray into limited (plus whatever other debauchery he can sneak past Chev). Julian will also be streaming, hopefully regularly. Thanks for stopping by! I know we look small now but I promise, we’re just getting started.

For those of you just joining me, welcome! Check out part 1 of this analysis where I cover aggro and tribal decks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexdrinkers.com/historically%20speaking/2020/09/09/historic2-1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Same as before, I’ve broken down the decks under these broader archetypes. I’ll only be covering the most prominent decks in the meta, we’ll save the brewing for later wink wink. So without further adieu, let’s finish our grand tour! “Midrange” Decks Midrange is a contentious term nowadays, with recent pushes in power seemingly squeezing it out of most formats, especially recent Standards. However, I’m using it to refer to decks that don’t go as low and fast as the aggro (or tribal) decks and are more proactive than the control decks we’ll discuss later. Golgari Sacrifice Artifacts 4x Bolas&#39;s Citadel Creatures 4x Blood Artist 3x Gilded Goose 2x Jadelight Ranger 4x Llanowar Elves 3x Llanowar Visionary 2x Paradise Druid 4x Priest of Forgotten Gods 2x Scavenging Ooze 4x Woe Strider Enchantments 2x Bastion of Remembrance Instants 4x Collected Company Lands 6x Forest 4x Overgrown Tomb 2x Phyrexian Tower 6x Swamp 4x Woodland Cemetery This deck represents a few different strands of a powerful sacrifice core. Tied together with Collected Company it often grinds value until it can pull off a pseudo-combo kill with Bolas’s Citadel . In general they’re Golgari, though some versions move towards Abzan, some towards Jund. Don’t worry if this sounds like a lot, we’ll go into the unique flavors of this build a little later but for right now let’s talk about the foundation they all have in common. The sacrifice core of this deck features the likes of Woe Strider , Priest of Forgotten Gods , and Blood Artist , among others. In their purest essence, these decks want to churn through their libraries using sacrifice value and eventually drain their opponents out with a Blood Artist effect. Woe Strider is another integral piece, providing a free sacrifice outlet which is absolutely key, giving you a goat to get the engines started, and can recur itself if you run out of gas. It also allows you to scry with each sacrifice as well which keeps the gas rolling, especially for Bolas’s Citadel , more on that later. Oh, also, Phyrexian Tower is a powerful Magic Card. The other all star of this deck is Priest of Forgotten Gods . It’s key in removing opposing creatures, especially something out of the Auras deck, or a lone Muxus, Goblin Grandee with the trigger on the stack. If you can get a Priest and some fodder out early, you can often keep your opponent off creatures for several turns, giving you the time you need to assemble your engine or just beat down. Lastly, the Priest draws (always good) and that double black mana boost can help on key multi-spell turns or for powering out a Citadel. Along with these sacrifice-based cards, the deck plays a whole suite of mana dorks like Llanowar Elves , Gilded Goose , and Llanowar Visionary . These ramp/fix you and also are prime sacrifice fodder when you need to get down to brass tacks. They tend to be unsatisfactory hits off Collected Company , but they’re a necessary evil and two mediocre hits are better than no hits. Finally, let’s discuss the hulking monstrosity in the room… Bolas’s Citadel . Much like Muxus, Goblin Grandee in Goblins, Citadel is the “I Win” card in Golgari Sac. With the draining effects of something like Blood Artist and low average CMC, you can tear through the top of your deck with little concern for your life, scrying away lands with Woe Strider . Dump enough creatures onto the board and sacrifice them for a machine gun effect to decimate your opponent’s life total. Sometimes you won’t be able to pull off the full combo and close out the game, but you’ll often be able to establish a healthy board presence and set up for a kill next turn. Variations on a (Sacrificial) Theme Now that we’ve discussed the basics of the deck, let’s hit on the different flavors real quick. Golgari is of course the most straightforward. They get to run all the dorks, a full four-of Bolas’s Citadel , and Bastion of Remembrance alongside Blood Artist for drain. They also get some flex slots where you might put a Jadelight Ranger or Nightmare Shepherd . This version is clean and tuned. It won’t have mana problems and it wants to bust out a Citadel as soon as possible to go off. Simple and effective, but its Company hits are the weakest on average and most importantly it isn’t … flashy. Jund versions of this deck trim their Citadels and often forego Blood Artist entirely to form a shell much akin to the Jund Food deck of recent Standards (a personal favorite deck of mine, check out this gameplay). Mayhem Devil is an A+ card in a shell such as this being able to remove blockers, clear fodder for a Priest of Forgotten Gods activation, or of course just pinging face. Alongside the Devil is good old Cat / Oven to make sure you’re maximizing that damage. I’ve seen lists run Bonecrusher Giant for value and Claim the Firstborn depending on how disruptive they want to be, but Mayhem Devil is one hundred percent worth the splash. Lastly, there are Abzan versions. These are probably my least favorite as they don’t gain enough for the mana inconsistency. The only white inclusions (at least in the main deck) is Cruel Celebrant , which is an excellent Blood Artist replacement or supplement, but doesn’t have the versatility that Mayhem Devil does. This deck is one of the most versatile in the meta and can take several different lines depending on the opponent. However, similar to Elves from pt 1, it can falter when you draw the wrong half of your deck. All mana dorks does you no good, and only having your payoffs won’t let you establish your engine as you’re sacrificing everything. Also, the “randomness” of your most powerful engines, Collected Company and Bolas’s Citadel can cause you to miss or stall out and that can often prove fatal. Too many times I’ve gotten my opponent down to two or three life and then hit double lands off the top with Citadel. Just as many times, I’ve needed a reasonable Company to retake board dominance and fuel a Priest, and I hit… a single measly Llanowar Elves . Feels bad man. And of course, any quick deck with good spot-removal can take out your key pieces (Strider, Priest, Devil) as you’re setting up and totally halt any progress. That being said, the raw power of your pieces and the adaptability of the deck will truly reward dedicated and detail-oriented play. Gruul Artifacts 2x Embercleave Creatures 4x Bonecrusher Giant 2x Earthshaker Khenra 4x Gruul Spellbreaker 1x Klothys, God of Destiny 4x Llanowar Elves 4x Lovestruck Beast 2x Pelt Collector 1x Rhonas the Indomitable 4x Robber of the Rich 4x Scavenging Ooze Instants 4x Collected Company Sorceries 2x Primal Might Lands 8x Forest 5x Mountain 4x Rootbound Crag 1x Sheltered Thicket 4x Stomping Ground Much less complicated than the previous set of decks, Gruul probably shouldn’t even be considered a midrange deck. A statement to how powerful aggro is in this format, Gruul is merely a midrange deck because it goes bigger and is a bit more resilient than your typical aggro deck. Shockingly similar to Gruul aggro/midrange in Standard (did you know they printed powerful cards this last year?) it often curves Pelt Collector into Robber of the Rich into Lovestruck Beast into Questing Beast , often with an Embercleave not far behind. Fat and hasty threats are the name of the game. Most of these cards don’t need any explaining, they’re just big and good at attacking. I will break down some of the more important ones though: Questing Beast continues to be a thorn in many players’ side, just like in Standard, and with the presence of a lot of low to the ground creature decks is usually unblockable. Chipping in for a free four damage a turn with vigilance to wall most things in the format is nasty. Robber of the Rich is a cheap, hasty threat, and since a lot of the interaction in this format is cheap and powerful, he can easily turn an opponent’s Thoughtsieze or Opt against them. Collected Company is back (go figure) and gets the most powerful cards pound for pound in this deck. Bonecrusher Giant , Lovestruck Beast , Gruul Spellbreaker , and Rhonas, the Indomitable all clock in at three mana, but with stats that hit far above that weight class. It’s like when the opposing team’s pitcher in Little League is 6 ft and 200 lbs. Except there’s two of them, they teleport into battle like damn ninja, they may or may not be vicious bestial humanoids, and you aren’t playing baseball. The last card I want to highlight is Primal Might . At worst it’s a one mana fight spell, which since your creatures are all huge, is just a straight up removal spell. But when the game is going long, you can pump up your creature to astronomical heights, remove their best blocker, and go to town. Add in trample from Rhonas, the Indomitable and you just close the game out right there! The biggest thing this deck has going for it is the raw POWER of each of its cards. There isn’t really any synergy, just the most efficient threats, pound for pound. Mana dorks to accelerate you and beaters at every point along the curve keep the pressure on while Collected Company refills you and Embercleave punches through defenses like a gaddang battering ram. You even get a bit of removal with Stomp and Primal Might , plus whatever Robber of the Rich might snag. RG monsters is back and man does it feel good. Control Decks Lastly, but not leastly, ye olde control decks. My personal favorite archetype, I was disappointed with control’s place in the meta. With the prominence of aggro decks and midrange decks that could be considered aggro decks, it’s hard for control to maintain a home, and of those I’ll mention, I’d really only consider one a true control deck. Sultai Ramp Creatures 4x Hydroid Krasis 4x Uro, Titan of Nature&#39;s Wrath Instants 2x Aether Gust 3x Eliminate 4x Growth Spiral 2x Heartless Act 1x Pact of Negation Sorceries 2x Extinction Event 1x Languish 1x Maelstrom Pulse 4x Thoughtseize Planeswalkers 4x Nissa, Who Shakes the World 1x Vraska, Golgari Queen Lands 4x Breeding Pool 1x Castle Locthwain 3x Drowned Catacomb 3x Fabled Passage 1x Fetid Pools 2x Forest 1x Hinterland Harbor 2x Island 4x Overgrown Tomb 2x Swamp 4x Zagoth Triome First, Sultai. I honestly hate this deck. It’s incredibly close to the Sultai of Standard that’s been dominant in some variation for nearly a year. You play your Growth Spiral s and Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath s, ramp to a Nissa, Who Shakes the World , and then play a humongous Hydroid Krasis to stabilize your life and completely refill your hand. You also get basically all the best interaction in Thoughtseize , Eliminate , and Aether Gust . The thing that I don’t like about this deck is there aren’t really any good play patterns and there isn’t any real decision-making. All your cards are stupidly powerful and can grind your opponent into oblivion. If something gets removed or countered, you already have enough backup to brush it off. Stick one threat and it can easily close the game. The only real decision is the number of Languish s or Extinction Event s you run, which by the way are the best sweepers in the format (and this includes freaking Wrath of God ). The list I’ve posted is generic, but feel free to customize your counterspell and removal suite. As long as you’re running four-ofs of Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath , Nissa, Who Shakes the World , Hydroid Krasis , and Thoughtseize , you pretty much can’t go wrong. I’m done with this deck, let’s move onto something better. Come get me Uro fans. Orzhov Yorion Companion Yorion, Sky Nomad Creatures 4x Burglar Rat 4x Charming Prince 2x Gonti, Lord of Luxury 2x Ravenous Chupacabra Enchantments 4x Demonic Pact 4x Doom Foretold 2x Elspeth Conquers Death 2x Elspeth&#39;s Nightmare 4x Oath of Kaya 1x The Eldest Reborn 4x Treacherous Blessing 3x Trial of Ambition Instants 2x Final Payment 3x Flicker of Fate 2x Mortify Sorceries 4x Thoughtseize Lands 2x Barren Moor 1x Castle Ardenvale 2x Castle Locthwain 4x Godless Shrine 4x Isolated Chapel 7x Plains 2x Secluded Steppe 7x Swamp 4x Temple of Silence A deck I don’t see super often on the ladder, Orzhov Yorion is one of the most interesting decks in the meta. It’s also one of the most fun to pilot and one of the most miserable to play against, but whatever. Functioning around blinking powerful enchantments (and y’all know how much I love enchantments), this deck’s pinnacle is establishing a loop with Yorion, Sky Nomad and Charming Prince . Yorion, Sky Nomad (as a Companion and in the maindeck) provides mass blink to all your hateful pieces. Charming Prince provides a way to rebuy your Yorions and if you can keep them both alive, they cycle in and out in a sort of lock to continually reset all your enchantments. The outcome? Your opponent has no permanents and no cards in hand. Nice. In terms of enchantments, we have all of the best. Elspeth is really coming in swinging between Elspeth Conquers Death and Elspeth’s Nightmare , both very powerful includes. They both do exactly what you want: removal and resource denial, whether that’s cards in hand, cards in graveyard, or taxing the opponent’s mana. Then, as the dust is clearing, you’ll get to reanimate a fallen Yorion to renew your opponent’s subscription to poundtown. Trial of Ambition and The Eldest Reborn provide spicy repeatable options to make your opponent sacrifice, which is key against any decks packing protection. Oath of Kaya provides a repeatable Lightning Helix effect, and while it helps keep our opponent from having permanents (in case you couldn’t tell, that’s the plan), it also goes to the face and can close out games. The two crown jewels of this deck are Doom Foretold and Demonic Pact . Doom Foretold is Trial or Eldest on steroids and won’t stop until your opponent has no permanents and that sacrifice trigger is the final nail in the coffin. Often the best option for an opponent who doesn’t have an abundance of nonland permanents already is to just sandbag and wait for the Foretold to pop, which gives us time to set up even more lock pieces and strip any chance of our opponent from winning, by playing something like a Demonic Pact . Demonic Pact does everything we could ever want. We can pick off creatures, refill our hand, and even more important in this deck, deny our opponents resources. Then before that pesky fourth choice comes around, we just blink it and get back to the sweet, sweet value. Or we cast Final Payment and sacrifice it, another sweet line of tech. Either way, what I’m trying to say is demonic pacts are fun and don’t pose us a liability. Highly recommend. The final part of this deck that I think is great is its customizability. Yes, I love enchantments, and there’s already plenty of great options, but if you want to go for a more creature-centric build you can! Ravenous Chupacabra is a great addition to merk anything and everything while Burglar Rat provides your discard effect. This deck can be slow to start and definitely demands more thought intensive lines of play, but the sheer off-the-wall construction of the deck, getting to play a deck essentially devoid of staples, and the utter domination that comes from pulling out a win with this deck is worth it. Azorius Control Enchantments 3x The Birth of Meletis 1x Cast Out 2x Seal Away 2x Search for Azcanta 3x Shark Typhoon Instants 1x Blink of an Eye 4x Censor 2x Dovin&#39;s Veto 3x Hieroglyphic Illumination 2x Pact of Negation 1x Settle the Wreckage 2x Sphinx&#39;s Revelation Planeswalkers 2x Narset, Parter of Veils 3x Teferi, Hero of Dominaria Sorceries 3x Wrath of God Lands 2x Castle Ardenvale 3x Field of Ruin 4x Glacial Fortress 4x Hallowed Fountain 4x Plains 3x Irrigated Farmland 6x Island Finally, we’ve come to the end. My favorite deck in my favorite archetype. Good ol’ Azorius Draw-Go Control. The only true control deck in this article and pretty much the only tiered control deck in the meta, this harkons to the glory days of the archetype. Rife with counterspells, removal, card advantage, and a noticeable lack of win-conditions, I love this deck. But it isn’t really that good. It’s inherently reactive by nature, counter/remove your opponent’s threats until they don’t have any. Then you can think about slowly winning through something like a Shark Typhoon or Castle Ardenvale . With so much of the meta being hyper-proactive and able to go wayyyy under this deck, testing was rough. The upside is you can answer pretty much anything. Censor and Dovin’s Veto continue to be excellent counter spells with Pact of Negation allowing for you to tap out on crucial turns with back up. Cast Out and Seal Away both exile with the former able to hit problematic permanents. Settle the Wreckage is a great safety valve, especially against something like Goblins and Wrath of God continues to prove why it is the OG. Opponents can’t afford to overcommit to the board against this deck. Azorius Control also packs the best raw card advantage. Hieroglyphic Illumination was an excellent pickup with its ability to scale. Narset, Parter of Veils continues to dig way farther than she should and Search for Azcanta is amazing in the late game when it flips. Lastly, Sphinx’s Revelation is in this deck. I think that’s all I need to say, that card slaps. Finally, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria aka “Scourge of Dominaria Standard” tops off our deck. This is generally our best card and can run away with the game if we stick him. He does basically everything. However, I think the sad truth is that this just isn’t enough anymore. Even with some of the best control cards ever printed, I don’t think trading one for one with the opponent is going to cut it in today’s format. Even with the best sideboard cards in the entire meta, being reactive instead of proactive often can’t compete. I’ll continue to play this deck cause I love it, but I wouldn’t take this to a tournament anytime soon. A Challenger Approaches Well, that concludes the second and final part of this metagame analysis! I hope you enjoyed and learned something so you can go out and crush those queues. Let us know on Twitter or in the comments below which of these decks you’re loving (or hating) and if you’ve found any tweaks that give you the edge in your match-ups.

For the rest, here’s the breakdown!&lt;/p&gt; There’s something wonderful about playing mono-color in commander. Nowadays there are so many “must-play” cards being added to the format (looking at you Arcane Signet ) that it can feel the more colors you play, the less room you have to add your commander’s unique package. Think about the infrastructure required to get a rainbow deck going compared to a color combination that’s less mana-taxing. Monocolor doesn’t exactly get rid of all the required cards, every color has them, but playing with less colors means there are fewer cards you feel compelled to play. Of course there is a downside. Playing with only one color means you really are beholden to the restrictions of that color. Red can’t deal with enchantments, White doesn’t really draw cards, Green has a hard time losing games. Things have to be kept balanced! Joking aside, this week I want to take a look at my FAVORITE monocolor style, ever since I purchased the Sworn to Darkness C14 precon. Mono-black. Welcome back to Homebrewed, it’s been a while. I have to fit article-writing in between relaxing on the beach and enjoying the California sun so it’s been tough you know? Don’t worry, it’ll be worth the wait, I promise. As you might have picked up, The Hexdrinkers have been doing weekly game nights as a way to test out new strategies and build ideas in a real setting while also being able to stay close and of course, play Magic. The past couple weeks I’ve strayed from my typical rotation of Hapatra shenanigans, Eldrazi nonsense, and Coin-Flip insanity to a different deck: Toshiro Umezawa . This incredibly unique commander from Betrayers of Kamigawa (In fact, isn’t he THE Betrayer? I’ll have to check with Eric…) really encourages a unique playstyle for Black. I mean yes it’s wrapped in murdering as many creatures as possible, but you don’t often see Black reanimating anything but creatures. Focusing on instants gets you at LEAST double the murder mayhem. Plus, Black has some real surprise cards that’ll have people scratching their heads as to why they were allowed to exist. You’ll love this deck if: You’re a spellslinger trying to branch out of Izzet You love having answers to your opponents’ nasty creatures 90% of the time You like having multiple play avenues at any given time (Editor’s note: Don’t we all…?) You want to give green ramp a run for its money Maybe this deck isn’t quite for you if: You’re looking to take advantage of Black’s creature suite You want the love and affection of anyone else at the table You prefer a more linear playstyle. Well. Ish. Okay so it’s linear in the “kill a creature, re-cast a kill spell, kill another creature, until the mana runs dry” kinda way. But there’s some surprising versatility there! …Although now I say that out loud it sounds kinda murder-y… Permanents are your friends The best way I have to describe this build is Black Spellslinger. It wouldn’t be wrong to say you’re trying to cast at least one instant per turn once Toshiro hits the board, and squeezing every last trigger out of the recently deceased. Also an advance warning: the first few times you whip this out you WILL misplay. I’m still doing it. There are so many options at any given time that unless you give it your full attention, you’ll be leaving value on the table. And that’s a really good thing!! Honestly, most of my decks run a little on the janky side so having something more interesting is scratching an itch I didn’t know I had! With that - on to the build! Kill la Kill Funnily enough the core of this deck is also the part that’s most ripe for experimentation. Black is obviously rife with creature removal so your options for which pieces to run are almost endless. Here I’ve decided to highlight just a couple of my favorites. But hey! “Y’all do y’all”, as Julian would say. Curtains’ Call is from that Commander 2016 cycle of cards that has Undaunted, aka they cost less for each opponent you have. I don’t think I’ve ever seen any others played outside of Sublime Exhalation but destroying two target creatures for (usually) 3 mana is a steal. This is also your first reminder that any kill spell that pulls double duty results in TWO triggers for Toshiro, so use that as you will. (Fun rules fact: You can target an instant you just cast to destroy a creature with the resulting Toshiro trigger. So something like Malicious Affliction can be cast from your hand to kill one thing, targeted with Toshiro’s ability, and then be cast from the yard to kill two more thanks to Morbid. Food for thought.) Snuff Out along with Slaughter Pact (and to a lesser extent Deadly Rollick - cause it exiles) can be cast for 0 when you need them and boy oh boy, coming across one copy of these can be annoying enough but two?? That’s a potential of six free pieces of targeted removal per game. Drag to the Underworld is nothing special, but due to its recent printing it might not show up as high on usage charts. I’m here on its behalf to remind you that with Toshiro out this will just cost double black and be a very cost efficient removal spell Outside of instants, might I also suggest the following for your death triggers? Turns out Black’s pretty good at wiping things out at sorcery speed too… Boardwipes are a critical part of any EDH build, and here they pull double duty. One-sided wraths like In Garruk’s Wake will clear the way for your army of darkness and give Toshiro a bounty of triggers, while more symmetrical wipes like Damnation will still allow Toshiro to “see” everything else dying which you can utilize for some more instants. What more could you want! Feed the Swarm is Black’s first foray into targeted enchantment removal which has been one of Black’s weaknesses since the beginning so while it can destroy creatures, it’ll probably be used for the other mode more often than not. The Other Spells When you’re not raining hellfire, sometimes you need spells that do OTHER things. I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes you’ll want these even more than kill spells. Succumb to Temptation is one of the only Black draw spells at instant speed outside of Wretched Confluence . Can you believe that?? Either way, I cannot think of a game I haven’t cast this twice and been all the better for it. Withering Boon and Imp’s Mischief fall flatly in the category of “Wait, Black can do that???” An Essence Scatter for an additional 3 measly life? Of course! I’ve found people will expect the Spanish Inquisition more than the mono black player to have a response to their creature. Imp’s Mischief is the same deal; not necessarily a counter, but at least it’ll redirect someone’s malicious intent… or steal a game-winning spell. Either way, use it! Death by 1000 Pings Toshiro gives each creature death fantastic utility - but this is Black! He shouldn’t be the only one out there basking in the misery of others! That’s where the squad comes in. Pick your favorites. I know there will be Blood Artist or Bastion of Remembrance fans out there but for me I’ve gotta go with these guys: Syr Konrad, the Grim and Massacre Wurm have each won me games with this build. Sometimes from wiping out solid boardstates flinging fast and furious instants or a well-timed In Garruk’s Wake , but in every case, the pings really add up. As for Reaper from the Abyss …well taking down an extra creature per turn is icing on an already scrumptious cake. But for what we’re really trying to accomplish, those guys are just the beginning. Let me introduce you to our real game-winners. Literally the dynamic Duo, Revel in Riches has an alternate wincon that is easily achievable in just a couple turns. Even if it gets taken out, odds are you’re up on mana from when you cast it. Black Market is an older flavor, but even more potent in the mana generation department once it really gets a fat stack of counters, something we’re happy to assist and provide. Some games I’ve been able to cast my entire hand without touching my landbase. Big Mana This is a pretty typical package, but for those of you that don’t know, Black can pull off some absolutely heinous stuff when it comes to mana generation. Mostly it’s due to two key cards and their variants: Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth and Cabal Coffers . We run both along with Expedition Map . Basically, with both are on the field all your lands become swamps and then you can just tap two to activate Cabal Coffers to add mana equal to your entire land count to your mana pool. This is, how you say, broken. And your friends will hate it. I’ve also added Coffers’ little brother Cabal Stronghold and Manascape Refractor for redundancy. Most games, you’ll end up with more mana than you know what to do with, which is perfect for a game-winning Torment of Hailfire . Oh and if you’re really feeling it, toss in a Thespian’s Stage or a Magus of the Coffers for good measure. You’ll thank me. Final Shoutouts While most cards fit nicely into boxes, there are a couple I want to give special attention to for their continued support in this deck’s ability to wreck face. Primal Amulet is a fun way to trick opponents into thinking you probably can’t cast anything with the one mana you have open and then BAM! Heartless Act . But what’s even better is when you flip it…Yes, you read Primal Wellspring right. In a deck with such a high instant count this gets exponential quickly as it doubles our Toshiro triggers as well. I quickly realized why there’s been a greater push for land destruction in EDH. Sangromancer brought me back from the brinks of Hell in a couple games. Not only does murdering everything kind of paint a target on your back, but to utilize things like Phyrexian Arena and Necropotence you’re going to be losing a fair bit of life. Given a few turns, Sangromancer can turn all that around. Gravebreaker Lamia is not only Entomb on a stick, but also makes our Toshiro triggers that much more efficient and attainable. Oooo boy. Conclusion And that’s it! A powerful Black commander that can bring the hurt consistently and provide a greater challenge to pilot than what I usually bring to the table. I highly recommend giving Toshiro a look and drawing a few sample hands. You won’t look back… For the full list, pop over here!

History isn’t written overnight and I’ve been taking my time to test many decks from the meta and playing against even more. I came out victorious in many battles, but I also did a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of losing (hence the title, and also cause I wanted to continue the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; references). It wasn’t all for naught though. After all that struggle, I think I’ve finally come up with a comprehensive overview of what’s out there as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each deck.&lt;/p&gt; I’ve broken down the decks under broad archetypes and then will discuss specific decks within and close out with more broad conclusions. But with so much to cover, I think it’s best to just jump right in! Tribal Decks There are three notable tribal decks in the format, uncoincidentally, some that have had the longest and most successful histories in Magic: Goblins, Elves, and Merfolk. All three have a plethora of good creatures to choose from as well as a healthy selection of lords and can be held together by one of the pillars of the format, Collected Company . Merfolk Companion Jegantha, the Wellspring Creatures 4x Benthic Biomancer 4x Deeproot Elite 4x Kumena&#39;s Speaker 4x Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca 4x Merfolk Mistbinder 4x Merrow Reejerey 4x Mist-Cloaked Herald 4x Silvergill Adept Instants 4x Collected Company Lands 4x Breeding Pool 4x Forest 2x Hashep Oasis 4x Hinterland Harbor 8x Island 2x Temple of Mystery Merfolk is arguably the weakest at the moment. It does benefit from access to Collected Company , but it’s still really just a deck from Ixalan Standard, “a notoriously less powerful standard (especially compared to the last year cough cough”). Merfolk Mistbinder and Merrow Reejerey are both high quality lords. Silvergill Adept helps keep a stream of merfolk to play. Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca is a phenomenal payoff as well as a crucial engine to make the deck run. She’s definitely the most powerful card in the deck and luckily with four toughness is harder to kill due to the prevalence of Shock and three-damage burn spells. Deeproot Elite can buff up your merfolk though it takes a bit longer than is acceptable in this format and can get removed quickly. In the early game, Merfolk lack the explosive mana generation of Elves or Goblins to establish a dominating board presence quickly. While they can build up an impressive army and beat out other generic creature deck, any deck that tries to go under then can either push damage quicker or at least take out key pieces before critical mass is achieved. A Thoughtseize or removal spell (of which there are many cheap ones in the format) can tear you apart and set you back a turn or more in the early game, which is a death sentence. Elves Creatures 4x Allosaurus Shepherd 4x Dwynen&#39;s Elite 4x Elvish Archdruid 4x Elvish Clancaller 4x Elvish Visionary 4x Imperious Perfect 4x Llanowar Elves 3x llanowar Visionary 4x Paradise Druid Instants 4x Collected Company Lands 2x Castle Garenbrig 15x Forest 4x Hashep Oasis Elves function on a similar game plan to Merfolk; establish a dominating board presence thanks to a low average CMC and a plethora of lords. Where Elves rises above our fishy friends is in its mana generation. Llanowar Elves , Paradise Druid , and Llanowar Visionary all help your mana explode to deploy your hand at a blistering pace. Elvish Visionary keeps the train rolling, Dwynen’s Elite provides another body, and then there are three phenomenal lords: Elvish Clancaller , Imperious Perfect , and Elvish Archdruid , all with excellent secondary effects. Tying the Elven menace together is Collected Company which can turn your board from unimposing to a major threat in an instant (Editor’s note: …. Was that a pun? 3/10 at best). Elves have the explosivity that Merfolk lacks, and you can even adjust my list to include honorary elf Craterhoof Behemoth (searched up by Fierce Empath ) to really close games with a thunder of footfalls. Where Elves stumbles is when you draw all mana and no gas. A board full of Llanowar elves is nothing if you don’t have an Archdruid or Clancaller to beef them up. Also, of course, a well timed removal spell can turn an alpha strike into a slaughter of your forces. Goblins Creatures 4x Conspicuous Snoop 2x Gempalm Incinerator 4x Goblin Chieftain 4x Goblin Instigator 1x Goblin Ringleader 4x Goblin Warchief 4x Krenko, Mob Boss 4x Muxus, Goblin Grandee 4x Skirk Prospector 4x Wily Goblin Lands 3x Castle Embereth 2x Forgotten Cave 18x Mountain 2x Phyrexian Tower Lastly, we have Goblins, the best tribal deck, and potentially the only “combo deck” in the meta. Goblins only has one true lord, Goblin Chieftain , but their ability to give haste with either Chieftain or Goblin Ringleader more than makes up for that. Goblins can strike out of nowhere, which makes them a big threat. They also have healthy mana generation with Wily Goblin making a treasure, Chieftain reducing all your goblins, and Skirk Prospector being an absolute all-star when it comes to powering out our high end goblins, especially considering how wide Goblins can go (see Krenko, Mob Boss and Goblin Instigator ). Plus Goblins can keep up the card advantage with the new addition of Conspicuous Snoop and veterans Goblin Ringleader or Goblin Matron . But of course, we have to talk about Muxus, Goblin Grandee . Muxus is what puts this deck over the top and why I call it a combo deck. Often, the best thing to be doing is getting Muxus out there as quickly as possible, using Wily Goblin , Goblin Chieftain , and Skirk Prospector ’s insane mana generation (plus Phyrexian Tower at times). A turn three or four Muxus isn’t out of the question and can even be common. And depending on your luck with the trigger, you can easily end the game right there, or at least mortally wound your opponent giving them a single turn to deal with your army. As the deck I played the most, and my favorite during testing, I can say that this deck can live or die by variance. A Muxus flip of only one or two goblins can lose you the game and even if you get a veritable army, no haste can leave you vulnerable to Wrath of God which is running rampant in midrange and control decks. Also, with a six mana Muxus that you’re striving to get to, this deck runs a reasonable number of lands, but that can translate into flood if you get to a quick start and then get wrathed or dismantled which can stagnate and catch you an L. Overall, tribal decks are fun for their explosiveness and the potential to attack with a thick board of pumped up creatures. Also, the ability of all three of these decks (yes I even saw some goblins decks splashing) to play Collected Company is a boon. However, these decks generally lack the interaction to prevent an opponent’s game plan and are very weak to opposing interaction, especially in the early game when attempting to build a board state and a single stumble can crumble your whole plan. Aggro Decks Aggro decks is a wide label, which arguably includes tribal decks, but I’ve identified a few distinct archetypes that stood out: Rakdos Arcanist, Lurrus Auras, and everyone’s favorite… Burn! Lurrus Auras Companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den Creatures 4x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 3x Gingerbrute 4x Kor Spiritdancer 3x Ornithopter 3x Selfless Savior Enchantments 4x All that Glitters 3x Cartouche of Knowledge 3x Cartouche of Solidarity 4x Curious Obsession 4x Staggering Insight Instants 3x Karametra&#39;s Blessing Lands 4x Glacial Fortress 4x Hallowed Fountain 4x Island 8x Plains 2x Temple of Epiphany Lurrus Auras is an Azorius Bogles-esque deck. Boasting a ton of one mana or zero mana creatures (hello Ornithopter ) it can quickly suit up something harmless into an intergalactic menace (“Call Voltron to save us! Wait, our enemy is Voltron? Nooooooooo!”). By far the most important cards in the deck are the Curiosity effects, Curious Obsession and Staggering Insight . Being able to draw with every hit (this deck does not block, that’s for cowards) keeps the advantage snowballing. Stack up multiple of these on an Ornithopter or Gingerbrute and your opponent will be hard pressed to catch up. The cherry on top is Kor Spiritdancer . A veteran from Modern Bogles, she was introduced with Jumpstart and can get oppressively big while continuing to rip through your deck. Playing your final aura onto a Spiritdancer, drawing another aura, rinse and repeat until you run out of mana, is an easy and common line. This deck also plays Lurrus of the Dream-Den because why not, so of course it can grind and return any auras for a second run, just when your opponent thought they’d gotten rid of the pesky things. The weakness of this deck is you can get X-for-one’d if your opponent removes your Megazord, especially if they remove your creature out from under an aura on the stack. Alseid of Life’s Bounty and Karametra’s Blessing provide protection at key chokepoints, especially against decks heavy with removal or if you aren’t off to a blistering start (which can be common). The other weakness of this deck is of course going all in on a creature can make it hard to rebuild. Spiritdancer and the Curiosity effects are crucial for keeping a full grip so you can continue applying pressure. Burn Companion Jegantha, the Wellspring Creatures 4x Earthshaker Khenra 4x Ghitu Lavarunner 2x Grim Lavamancer 3x Rampaging Ferocidon 4x Soul-Scar Mage 4x Viashino Pyromancer Instants 4x Lightning Strike 4x Shock 4x Wizard&#39;s Lightning Sorceries 4x Light Up the Stage 1x Pillar of Flame 2x Skewer the Critics Lands 16x Mountain 4x Ramunap Ruins Burn has been a red mage’s ace in the hole since Lightning Bolt got printed, which if you aren’t an MTG history buff, was in the first dang set. Another deck imported from Modern, Historic Burn is a powerful and wildcard-inexpensive deck (Budget players rejoice!). Burn, like a lot of these decks, wasn’t a viable option until Amonkhet Remastered was released. Ghitu Lavarunner , Viashino Pyromancer , Shock , and Lightning Strike make a nice start for a deck with cheap threats and direct damage…but Earthshaker Khenra , Soul-Scar Mage , and Ramunap Ruins allow the deck to hum like a finely tuned, mach-speed, machine. Ramunap Ruins is just extra reach for the late game, but it can really allow you to push damage and be a little reckless with your attacks when you know you have four to six damage waiting on the field to close out an opponent. In a similar vein, Earthshaker Khenra also allows this deck to last a lot longer than normal mono-red decks. Khenra pushes damage early with its ETB and then when you’ve flooded out or have been slowly ground to a minimal board state, eternalize that bad boy and smash face out of nowhere. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition and no one expects a 4/4 in a burn. Lastly, Soul-Scar Mage functions as our Monastery Mentor with its 1/2 body for one mana and prowess. Its pseudo-wither ability is also far from negligible. With the amount of burn spells, most prominently Wizard’s Lightning (aka Lightning Bolt because most creatures in this deck are incidentally wizards), Soul-Scar can reliably be a 3/4 or 4/5 hitting unobstructed because you’ve removed any blockers. Burn’s greatest strength is its ability to get going fast, disrupt anything its opponent might be doing in terms of blocking and then close out with prowess buffs or direct damage. If you’re any kind of creature deck, especially one that focuses on small creatures, burn can run you over easily if you stumble, and sometimes even if you don’t. However, if you’re playing disruption like Thoughtseize and lots of removal or thick creatures, you can essentially brick wall burn. Also, any sort of deck that gains incidental or buckets of life can be an issue, as you might expect. Rakdos Arcanist Companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den Creatures 4x Dreadhorde Arcanist 4x Kroxa, Titan of Death&#39;s Hunger 4x Priest of Forgotten Gods 4x Stitcher&#39;s Supplier 3x Young Pyromancer Instants 4x Shock 3x Village Rites Sorceries 4x Claim//Fame 3x Claim the Firstborn 1x Innocent Blood 4x Thoughtseize Lands 4x Blood Crypt 4x Dragonskull Summit 6x Mountain 3x Phyrexian Tower 5x Swamp Finally, we have what I would argue is the best deck in the format right now: Rakdos Arcanist. Also lovingly called “Rakdos, You Can’t Have Any Fun” (at least by me), this deck is brutally fast and efficient at making sure you do everything and your opponent doesn’t do anything. If you can’t tell, I lost to this deck way too many times. I have the empty ice cream containers to prove it. The name refers to Dreadhorde Arcanist , which is the card that makes this deck so potent. It also hosts a bevy of cheap, powerful spells (I’m sensing a trend), such as Shock and Thoughtseize to stall and dismantle any early gameplan. Then when your Arcanist attacks, they can then get “flashed back” at instant speed. The graveyard can easily get filled by the playset of Stitcher’s Supplier which will happily chump block to continue to keep your yard stocked for Arcanists or to escape a Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger , another effect tool to deprive opponents of resources. And if your Arcanist bites the dust, Claim can get it back for a single mana! Or if your Arcanist is lonely, you can grab them a friend out of the yard! Fame , the back half of Claim can have your Arcanist getting an attack hastily, while boosting its power to increase the range of spells it can hit, if you’ve chosen to include something like Bedevil at three CMC. Young Pyromancer rounds this deck out and goes wide quickly with how many spells are getting cast per turn. To keep up card advantage, Village Rites often is included, which gets especially dirty when you can Claim the Firstborn to clear the way for your Arcanist and then immediately grave-cast a Rites. Similar to Burn, this deck can move incredibly fast and can disrupt anything an opponent does early to trip them up. Where it excels is its ability to accumulate mountains of card advantage with getting free second casts off of most of its spells and completely stripping its opponent of options through discard. Haste from Fame and “burn” from Kroxa gives just enough reach to finish off a player who thought they had stabilized the onslaught. Aggro decks are flourishing in Historic. Cheap, powerful spells have always been at a premium and this format is full of them. The clincher is that there is a mix of these that are threats, a la Earthshaker Khenra and Soul-Scar Mage and also answers, both reactive and proactive (things like Eliminate and Thoughtseize , respectively). The Story So Far… The name of the game in Historic is to go fast and be disruptive. If you’re a slow deck or if you have no way to disrupt your opponents gameplan, you aren’t going to succeed. Decks like Merfolk and Elves don’t hold a candle to Rakdos Arcanist which can not only go faster, but can stop them at every step of the game. Azorius Auras can thrive because it can protect its threat against this disruption or get big enough to shake off burn spells. Another key is not trading resources at an even rate with your opponent. Eternalizing an Earthshaker Khenra or flashing back a Thoughtseize with a Dreadhorde Arcanist is peak card advantage when resources have run dry. A single Curious Obsession on an Ornithopter turn one can draw three or more cards in a game. Started Blasting Gun GIF from Startedblasting GIFs Lastly, prioritize your best cards and what you need to get your gameplan moving. Each deck has a few key cards that are much more important than the rest, proactively and reactively. I think my biggest mistake while testing was not taking enough mulligans. The biggest example of this is in Goblins where cards like Skirk Prospector are key to generating the mana needed to cast Muxus, Goblin Grandee , which should be your Plan A, every single game. A mull to five with one of each of those is probably better than a full grip of seven with four average to good goblins. Next time we’ll test these tenants again as we look into midrange and control decks! What can these archetypes do to overcome the decks I’ve discussed here?

After a raucous romp with Syr Carah a while ago, I think it’s time to chill out a bit. I’ve come prepared this week, I’ve done my research, and I’ve even planned both decks before starting the article! &lt;em&gt;Cue applause&lt;/em&gt;. Thank you, thank you… but in all seriousness, let’s get right into it. This week we’ll be staying on &lt;em&gt;Eldraine&lt;/em&gt; and looking to &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link external-card-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/eld/326/chulane-teller-of-tales?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/8/3/83f43730-1c1f-4150-8771-d901c54bedc4.jpg?1571282906&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Chulane, Teller of Tales &lt;/a&gt; as our commander. By the way, did you know it’s pronounced ‘Hull-an’? Told you I did my prep work this time.&lt;/p&gt; Chulane was designed to support the soft reboot of the Brawl format and he certainly has the power to do so. His triggered ability helps you keep your hand full and your mana base growing, while his activated ability can help protect important creatures or repeat powerful enter the battlefield (ETB) effects. When looking at the casual list I realized I was putting a lot of creatures into the deck to maximize these ETBs. This made me curious… Do I have enough creatures and other permanents to build a Primal Surge deck? The answer is I can certainly try! Meanwhile, for the competitive deck I was able to find an incredible primer for the iCameo (an abbreviation of the deck’s wincons) build written by the user Joking101 that helped inspire this article. iCameo is an adaptive combo build that uses Chulane’s triggered ability to nearly deck itself then win through combat damage. If you want to cut straight to the cEDH portion of the article, click HERE . Otherwise, let’s jump right in with our casual Primal Surge deck. Joking101’s Primer casual build Chulane Surges In! This deck will run you right around $250. I think this deck is actually a great example of how I want my casual decks to play. They should have a solid game plan, multiple win conditions, and should feel cool to pilot. During testing for this, I felt like I nailed all those aspects. I think I was aided in no small part by the star of the show: Primal Surge . This card is not just powerful and cool, and to use it to its full advantage we have to succumb to one of the most stringent deck building restrictions this side of Companion: don’t include any other instants or sorceries in your deck. “Why would I ever do that Eric?” Well, I’ll tell you. This will allow us to dump every other card left in our deck straight into play. Then, we immediately go for the win with cards like Thassa’s Oracle or Laboratory Maniac provided any of our other creatures’ ETBs let us draw a card. (This is where cards like Mulldrifter and Mentor of the Meek can really shine.) The unfortunate thing about this game plan is that short of Ring of Three Wishes it’s pretty hard to tutor for Primal Surge . So, we may end up drawing some of our key creatures before we find it. In order to help assuage this potential issue, we’ve peppered in some other win cons that work well with Chulane and our current shell. Eldrazi Displacer and Deadeye Navigator to generate infinite mana with Peregrine Drake or Palinchron . If we have infinite mana with Palinchron in play we can cast Chulane, Teller of Tales , if he isn’t already on the field, then bounce and replay Palinchron until we draw any of Destiny Spinner , Helix Pinnacle , or Primal Surge . If either of your Lab Man effects are still in the deck then you can just keep drawing until you win (Remember to actually play the creature before you try to draw the final time… I mean, like you wouldn’t forget, you’re cool. I’m just warning everyone else). If those have been removed or are sitting in your hand, Destiny Spinner can make some pretty threatening lands. This is doubly effective if we just cast Primal Surge and have literally all our enchantments and all our lands in play. Alternatively we can pump all that mana straight into Helix Pinnacle and pass, hoping to win on our upkeep. It’s Dangerous to Go Alone So, take these protection spells with you! Having a five mana commander and a ten mana win condition is… bold, to say the least. We can’t just sit there hoping everyone will be nice and let our terrifying spells resolve. So, we have to find some creative ways to counter spells or delay our opponents without instants or sorceries. A few creatures are just counterspells, see Mystic Snake and Frilled Mystic , but they’re a little on the pricey end CMC-wise. Fortunately for us, they come with a body and if we have Chulane out they draw us a card and can even ramp us. Ashiok’s Erasure doesn’t have the benefits of being a creature, but is very effective at protecting us from common spells like Counterspell or Swords to Plowshares . If we are going for a power turn or trying to win, it may be worth it to look to Grand Abolisher as a more definitive way to deny interaction. We don’t always want to be quite so reactive though. Sometimes it’s much better to go and blow up people’s stuff before they start causing us problems. Caustic Caterpillar and Reclamation Sage both help us hate on artifacts and enchantments. We can even bounce Reclamation Sage with Chulane to get repeated benefit out of its effect. Terastodon can also help clean up noncreature permanents, but that still leaves us lacking in terms of ways to kill our opponent’s threatening or high value creatures. To resolve this problem we can run cards like Banishing Light and Journey to Nowhere . Calix, Destiny’s Hand can let us exile even more creatures under our enchantments. Repeatable removal tied to this ability is important for us given how limited removal can be without instants and sorceries.Some cards in a similar vein to this, but much better for targeting commanders are Song of the Dryads and Imprisoned in the Moon . These enchantments prevent our opponents from returning their commander to the zone. From here let’s move on to look at some of the more staple cards in our colors and how we can use Chulane to add some unique elements to our build. Rewriting a Classic Story Primal Surge doesn’t just limit our removal and control tools. Value generation and ramp often come from instants and sorceries, so we still need to find some cheeky workarounds in that category. The deck is full of low cost creatures, so we should be able to cycle through those pretty quickly given that each of them is a cantrip when Chulane is in play. Beast Whisperer lets us double up on drawing whenever we cast a creature and with cards like Abundance we can also maximize the value of each draw. Aid from the Cowl is another great enchantment for value maximization. As long as you’re using Chulane’s bounce ability, your deck is all permanents so it’s either a permanent into play or free ramp every turn. Coiling Oracle is a great card for us whether it’s acting as draw or ramp. But there are more consistent cards for ramping I’d like to look at. Wood Elves is an obvious one, it allows us to fetch forests, so we can even grab a few of the dual lands we managed to sneak into the budget. In a deck like this Springbloom Druid is Harrow on a stick and can put in some solid work for us with a few bounces. Avatar of Growth and Solemn Simulacrum both help keep the lands coming so that we can thin our deck and make sure we have all the right colors. Obviously we’re going to be running mana dorks, but I don’t think we need to discuss Elvish Mystic for the 100th time, no matter how much I want to. Once Upon a Time (Mulligan) Let’s make sure you get your tale off to a proper start with a good first hand. For our game plan if you have a hand that is even marginally keepable with Primal Surge , you should keep it. In most hands you’ll want to have a few lands and a few other pieces of ramp. We’ll be able to hit the gas pretty well once we get Chulane out onto the field, so keeping a hand full of pretty small creatures or mana dorks isn’t actually that hurtful. Chulane is a prime target for removal, so we should prioritize any hand that includes either protection or a secondary engine we can use to bait removal or keep things going if Chulane doesn’t work out. Removal is always nice to have, but we definitely want to get off the ground and get the ball rolling as quickly as we can. Drawing into interaction later can be better than sitting on it early, but that also depends on the speed of other decks at your table. In a more aggressive pod it can be worth it to keep a few pieces of interaction and wait to play Chulane until you can really get the engines going. The full decklist for this build can be found below. Full Decklist For now though, let’s continue on to Act II of our story, with the cEDH build of Chulane, Teller of Tales . For this list we will be going forward without any budget restrictions and strictly aiming to create the most powerful deck we can. Again, this list was inspired by the iCameo primer from the user Joking101. cEDH build What is this, a Marvel Movie? Chulane, Teller of Tales has such a ridiculously good triggered ability, that combos so easily, the competitive deck requires an acronym to understand the path to victory. iCameo represents the primary cards that allow us to reach the end state of our game plan. The cards in iCameo are Intruder Alarm , Cloudstone Curio , Aluren , Mana Breach , Earthcraft , and Overburden . These six cards represent our main path to victory. Our goal with these is to constantly bounce creatures that allow us to keep drawing and replaying the same cards. All of our combos start with casting Shrieking Drake , Whitemane Lion , or having Cloudstone Curio in play and casting one mana dork with another in play already. We’ll always target the creature we just played with the bounce, or the other dork for Curio lines, and have Chulane draw us a card and put a land into play. We can continue to pay for this process by profetting mana from tapping the creature before it’s bounced and untapping a land with Earthcraft . Alternatively Intruder Alarm and any mana dorks will have the same effects. From here we can repeat whatever sustainable loop we find ourselves in. We want to draw almost our entire deck, ideally put all our lands and enchantments into play and swing out with either Finale of Devastation or Destiny Spinner . Choose Your Own Adventure The key to an adaptive deck like this is to be well, adaptive. When piloting the deck we are constantly evaluating whether this is the time to be proactive or reactive. We have a lot of great mana ramp and acceleration like Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy and Priest of Titania that can help push us toward our game plan. But we also get to run cards like Mana Drain and Force of Will . The adaptability and game sense required to play this deck honestly is a big part of why I enjoy it. I even patched things up with the Azorius Senate just so that I could run Lavinia, Azorius Renegade . I think of her as our anti-Kinnan. She pumps the brakes for others in the same way he stomps on the gas for us. Much like Lavinia, Collector Ouphe and Drannith Magistrate are two great cards for a deck like ours, which is happy to spend resources to slow down the game and relies very little on artifacts. Any of your favorite hate bear style cards can easily slot into this deck if you find that these aren’t working well in your meta. What matters is that when you need to, you can slow other players down and bring the game to your tempo. Pumping the breaks and going slow is cool and all, but have you tried going really fast? It’s also pretty sick. With a five mana commander we can’t get too trigger happy and need to be very careful about when we play him, but in the right pod we can definitely fall into the most aggressive position drawing into one of our combos very early with the right start. We have the ramp to get our mana in place very quickly with the number of dorks we’re running. Once that is all setup, we can quickly find our winning cards with tutors like Enlightened Tutor , Sterling Grove or Trophy Mage . We can even find Whitemane Lion , Earthcraft , and Overburden by transmuting Muddle the Mixture . Once we have one of the enchantments or artifacts that we need, Ranger Captain of Eos , Recruiter of the Guard and Worldly Tutor can help us find the last pieces we need to close out the game.We run Crop Rotation just in case we don’t have the right lands or need Gaea’s Cradle in order to actually have a profitable loop. What Do We Say to the God of Death? Please take a seat for this next part, I have some unfortunate news for you all… the other players at the table are trying to kill us. I know, I know, it’s terrible. Take all the time you need to process. Due to the fact that we aren’t just trying to turbo out a win con, we are probably going to need to stop them from killing us before we can actually win. So, we’ll be running some ways to protect ourselves just in case. Angel’s Grace and Teferi’s Protection can save us in the case of a single burst of damage or some powerful targeted hate. Angel’s Grace can even save us from needing to use an early Pact of Negation . If we can see a power turn coming we don’t always have to be quite so reactive though. Silence is a great card that we can use to proactively shutdown someone’s turn before they even try to go off or we can use it to protect ourselves as we look to end the game. Even further in the proactive direction are cards like Rest in Peace or Linvala, Keeper of Silence which we can use to preemptively shut down some of our opponent’s win cons. Epilogue (Mulligan) Let us conclude the story of Chulane, Teller of Tales with a wrap on how to best start a game. Given that this deck has a high density of combos, tutors, and draw we can actually afford to be just a bit less choosy with our opening hands. We really need to start the game with a strong ramp opener though. That part of our game plan is pretty immovable. From there your mulligan diverges based on the other decks at the table. Often you might look around and feel like you’re playing one of the slower decks at the table. In that case, you should prioritize keeping control and stax pieces. You still need enough draw to get your own game plan into action down the line, but stopping others from snatching the game right away can often be key. I am fortunate enough to have some friends who believe that a fourway stax mirror is peak Magic, so we can also end up in the most “aggressive” position at the table in some scenarios. In those situations we should focus more on some of the protective cards I highlighted earlier. If we have the gas to win, we need to make sure those pesky control players and other player’s stax pieces don’t get in our way. The full deck list is linked below. I’ve included some other ways to win the game in the side board and have a full write up of each win condition in the primer. I’ll see you next time!

After a week and a half spent driving across the country and getting acclimated to the constant sunshine and mellow temperatures of Southern California, I can once again spend countless hours inside with the blinds closed playing Arena. We’re back…&lt;/p&gt; …and with quite the spicy brew! This deck actually took me quite some time to tweak and get juuust right, but I have a feeling you’ll love the end product. For this fine installment of Enter the Guildhall we’ll be following Radha, Heart of Keld as she tears a path across Dominaria leading her army of lands to victory a la Blackblade Reforged . This iteration of Radha is a departure from her “mana dork” roots, but what an explosive pump ability! And it can be repeated!! Ooooookay, huddle in and let’s talk strategy. It shouldn’t be a surprise that this deck is going to be base-green. Considering the only thing kinda Red about Radha’s design is first strike (although I guess you could make an argument for massive pump being Gruul given things like Xenagos, God of Revels ), the bulk of Radha’s ability suite will come from playing lands of all shapes and sizes; very Green indeed. Once we have a decent manabase online it’ll be time to swing in with Radha and a collection of Gruul allstars. Since we’re in Green we’ll include Questing Beast , Aggressive Mammoth , Nissa, Who Shakes the World , etc. but Red won’t be outdone. Now, I don’t want to give too much away in the intro but ahem BOY I sure am TERRIFIED of these PEAKS. More on that below. After that comes some super secret Gruul sauce I’ve wanted to try out and a dash of removal to spice it up. Presto! One haymaker fresh out of the oven. Lands, Ho! Beanstalk Giant pulls double duty as both decent ramp and coming down as an absolute wrecking ball if we’ve been doing our ramp correctly. There are few more destructive forces we can have in the late game when our entire plan is to play all the lands. Azusa, Lost but Seeking is exactly the kind of help we need to move through our deck once Radha is on the field. Given that we can play lands off the top of our library, dropping any potential dead draws straight onto the battlefield is a pretty freaking strong upside. We’re also including Dryad of the Ilysian Grove for exactly the same reason. Solemn Simulacrum is… okay so it doesn’t really need a highlight. It’s Sad Robot. But at the same time SAD ROBOT MADE IT INTO BRAWL!!! Just like Cultivate , seeing EDH staples rubbing shoulders with our Brawl ruffians just hits the feels the right way, ya know? And when that’s not enough, we’ve got Arboreal Grazer , Migration Path , and Migratory Greathorn as well as plenty of dorks like Incubation Druid and Paradise Druid making one final tour before rotation in a month-ish…I’ll really miss these guys, but I have high hopes for Zendikar! Generals, Sir. Elder Gargaroth is this year’s Questing Beast and I for one am here for it. Swapping Haste and Deathtouch for Reach and Trample as well as just a ridiculous swath of abilities make the Elder a auto-include, for better or for worse. Nyxbloom Ancient is our best chance to get a multi-activation Radha going and while I never was able to put the two together I honestly might just keep playing this deck until I do. With a chance to be tripling the land benefit as well as all the other ridiculous stuff Green can do with three times the mana Nyxbloom’s troops will leave no opponent standing. Terror of the Peaks is proof that there’s actually red in this deck. Terror is a uhh “Terror” on its own, but given Green’s propensity to be playing big creatures it’s a match made in heaven to systematically wipe your opponent’s board. And their face. Gimme That Good Gruul If you’ve been into Brawl since it’s return in Eldraine you know just how ridiculously strong Green is. I can say quite honestly it’s second to none and any decks I’ve schemed up with Green in them generally rely on it to do the heavy lifting. That being said, it would be wrong to completely ignore Radha’s Red tilt. We saw Terror of the Peaks above but there are some powerful pieces that make the perfect complement to Green’s rampant board domination. Fires of Invention might be out of Standard’s good graces, but in a deck where lands are the name of the game? The synergies are priceless. More often than not I’d end up playing a beefy spell, followed by a ramp spell, each turn until mana became a concern of the past. Is this card a lil broken? Yes. Does it still feel good to drop a Cavalier of Thorns and an Aggressive Mammoth in a single turn? (And as Julian pointed out to me, it also leaves your mana open for activated abilities, Radha approves of this development.) Rhythm of the Wild is one of Gruul’s best support pieces against the ridiculous number of people in Brawl’s queue who have the audacity to counter my spells. In the playtests I did to prepare for this article, three of the five games I played with this particular build were up against decks that played at LEAST seven counterspells each. I’m not about that, and Rhythm saved my butt many a time making sure we could play our big ugly monsters (and get Radha on the board which is usually quite difficult) Fling …is all I have to say about that. The Results So…I’m not lying when I say this deck has had the best record I’ve ever recorded with an Enter The Guildhall deck. When I finally put this list together after countless versions and tweaks I went 5-0, but I will concede two of those victories were due in part to opponent misplays. In one against Tamiyo, Collector of Tales - my opponent tried to Voracious Greatshark my Elder Gargaroth when Rhythm of the Wild was on the field which… didn’t go how they were expecting. In another close game against Thryx, the Sudden Storm I swung for lethal with a Radha that had mutated with Migratory Greathorn on top meaning my Radha was now a four cmc 3/4 with all the rest of her abilities. This became quite important when my opponent activated their Blast Zone for three (Radha’s cmc) and was left wondering why it hadn’t worked. In short, always read your opponents cards - even if you think you know what they do. They still could surprise you. That’s not to say this isn’t a super strong deck, it is! Hitting someone for 21 is satisfying to such a core level my inner caveman was jumping up and down beating his chest. This deck does what Gruul does best. Smash.

Today, Hexdrinkers treads into new territory… &lt;em&gt;Historic&lt;/em&gt;! I’ve been hearing increasing murmurs of the format and its potential greatness. With my interest in &lt;em&gt;Standard&lt;/em&gt; waning for the time being, and the recent shakeups across many formats, I figured this was a perfect time for me to fully delve into the format in a new series: &lt;em&gt;Historically Speaking…&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; But as I was booting MTGA up, I realized, I have no clue what I’m doing. So, for my benefit and your entertainment, this article will detail the beginning of my foray into Historic; how it works, the card pool, the in and outs, I’ll present my full research on all of this as a baseline for moving forward. I’ll also discuss the meta a bit, though that is in flux at the moment. This article will mostly act as a sort of primer and then I hope to get into gameplay and deck techs later on. The Island of Misfit Toys Historic is a non-rotating format exclusive to MTG Arena. This means that unlike Standard cards will stay in the format forever unless they’re banned. The Historic pool includes any cards that have ever made their way to Arena. Dominaria, Ixalan as well as the more recent pick-and-choose remasters but we’ll get to those in a minute. Since Historic was designed as a digital format, it also allows Wizards to tweak it and try new things on a much larger scale and more consistently. This is a uniqueness that you can’t get in paper formats or ones that have long standing histories. Now you may be thinking that just means bannings and unbannings will be much more frequent, but there are other ways to shake up the format that are more interesting and arguably healthier than constant banlist adjustment. Old Toys = New Toys Historic, similar to the precedent set by Modern Masters last year, has its own unique sets that inject cards directly into the format bypassing Standard completely. These Historic Anthologies are small, curated batches of cards from across Magic’s vast history designed to fill gaps in the format. Adding answers to unchecked strategies, fan favorites from history, or support for new archetypes that need a boost, that’s what these products do for the format.. Powerhouses from days gone by like Mirari’s Wake , Modern staples like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben , and even kitchen table favorites like Serra Ascendant . These anthologies cover a broad spectrum of interesting play styles and eras to make Historic truly unique. So far, three of these anthologies have been released. Historic Anthology I in November of 2019 brought 20 new cards, Historic Anthology II in March of 2020 had an increased 25 cards, and in May of 2020, Historic Anthology 3 upped the package again to 27 new cards to play with. Each one (which granted a playset of each card included) was available for 3400 gems on Arena, or individual cards could be crafted using the wildcard system. Though these are no longer available as bundles like before, Wizards has said they hope to drop new cards into Historic every quarter, so we can almost certainly expect anthologies 4, 5, etc. to drop moving into next year with a similar amount of cards (or slightly increased) and with a similar “price point”. Though that isn’t the only way new cards get added into Historic. In December of 2019, Rhys, the Redeemed was added into both Brawl and Historic as part of the Brawlidays special event. Though nothing like this has happened since, it’s safe to say that we could receive singular (or much smaller than an anthology) drops as part of special events at really any time. The most recent and largest addition to the format comes in the form of Jumpstart, the supplemental summer set released a few weeks back. Jumpstart included a host of tasty reprints as well as a slew of new cards to assist each theme (and cater to eternal formats). Because of this and with its release on Arena, Jumpstart cards also were added into Historic (with a caveat). Exciting! Time-Out So we have dedicated, curated drops, special event inclusions, as well as supplemental sets that can get added. All of these avenues mean the Historic card pool is continually growing and cards that are new and exciting as well as helpful to the meta are constantly being shuffled in. But sometimes action needs to be taken to help balance the format. I’m of course talking about the traditional way of “fixing” formats… Bannings. Something that we’ve been all too familiar with over the past year. Historic has a banned list just like other formats (in fact, it looks quite similar to Standard’s, more on that later), but it also has a second form of disciplinary action: the Suspension. Another benefit of an all digital format is that instead of having to go through the ordeal of outright banning something, Wizards can suspend cards, essentially putting them in “time-out”. A suspended card is not legal in the format, but it only remains in that status for a short time (usually one to two months). During this time, the meta can readjust and Wizards can watch to see if the format becomes healthier or if other problems arise. After the allotted time, the card either moves from suspension to banning, or can be reintroduced into the card pool. Most cards so far have gotten banned after serving their time, but some cards have been returned to the format and it sets a nice precedent for the future. Being able to more quickly take action, test the effects of certain changes, and also not having the feel-bads or negative PR of a true ban, the suspension system is interesting and probably good for Historic and one of the benefits of an all digital format. As Above, So Below Lastly, let’s discuss the Historic meta briefly, so we know what we’re getting ourselves into. Given the power of the last year and a half of printings and also the so far limited card pool of the format, a lot of it looks similar to recent Standard. Up until the suspensions, Temur Reclamation was the top deck with variation on Bant and Sultai Ramp also doing well and variations of Sacrifice and Mono-red jockeying for position. In previous iterations of the format, Fires of Invention or Winota, Joiner of Forces decks were dominant. Field of the Dead builds, usually with Golos, Tireless Pilgrim have wavered in and out of the top of the format, with Field being one of the cards that was initially suspended and then un-suspended. After digesting several metagame breakdowns and deck techs, I feel I have a reasonable understanding of the Historic metagame. One of the characteristics setting it apart from Standard is the presence of several powerful aggressive decks (though the recent bannings have started to prompt a resurgence in Standard). Mono-red, similar to its Standard counterpart, is strong and recently a top-tier version of a Goblins deck has emerged thanks to the additions in Jumpstart and Muxus, Goblin Grandee . Mono-green and mono-black both can compete, and there’s even a mono-blue aggro/tempo deck with Curiosity similar to the Mythic Championship winning deck from last year. Gruul aggro with the powerhouses Questing Beast and Embercleave has been tier one for quite a while (though it just took a hit with the explosive Burning-tree Emissary getting suspended). History is Written by the Victors With the recent regicide of Wilderness Reclamation , I suspect that these tier two decks will quickly rise to fill the space. Also, Jumpstart cards are still fresh and haven’t been tested fully, so I hope they will start to make even more impacts and soon we’ll have a new set in Zendikar Rising to shake things up even more! I’m excited to explore this fresh new format! Next week I’ll be doing a deeper dive into the current decks and testing some of them out. After that it’s off to the Hexdrinkers special laboratory to concoct up some lists of our own! Hit us up in the comments or on social media for anything you want to see me build around, and remember to stay brewin’ y’all!!

As a commander, he represents a resilient threat that’s able to provide ungodly amounts of value over the course of a long game. In this edition of Plus 40, we’re going to take a look at what kinds of cards compliment him and his powerful end-of-turn triggered ability in a Brawl and EDH setting.&lt;/p&gt; Oh, and this is Oakley here by the way. Nice to meet you and thanks for tuning in. On Removal Removal in all forms is such a pivotal and emblematic part of running a deck helmed by Athreos, Shroud-Veiled . Lucky for us, his color identity comprises perhaps the two colors best known in Magic for their effectiveness in creature removal, black and white. Ideally, we want removal that only kills a single creature to be instant speed. Nothing groundbreaking here but instant speed removal serves the auxiliary purpose of giving us an extra target every turn cycle that’s been marked by a coin counter. This helps us set up for much larger turnarounds using our opponent’s creatures against them. One of the best ways I’ve found to utilize this is to kill an opponent’s creature after they’ve declared attackers but before blockers are declared. Then, once that creature returns under your control, use it to ambush block another creature attacking you. Another form of spot removal I’d like to discuss here isn’t instant speed but provides other forms of synergy with Athreos, and that would be “O-ring” type effects: As we’ve discussed here before, targeting someone’s commander in Brawl or EDH with one of these cards generally results in the commander being sent back to the command zone. Along these same lines, when a creature with a coin counter is hit by an O-ring spell, rather than being temporarily trapped by the enchantment the creatures are exiled and instantly return to your side. I had considered various “flicker” spells for similar reasons, but found them to be too useless when Athreos wasn’t on the battlefield. Moving on to larger forms of removal, boardwipes are some of the most value-centric spells in the game. With Athreos’ coin counters this power is turned up to eleven, giving a single wrath effect the power to twist an unfavorable board state into a crushing victory: Thanks once again to Athreos’ triggered ability affecting creatures that are exiled, the pool for boardwipe options broadens to include cards like Extinction Event and Cry of the Carnarium . I’m not exaggerating when I say that cards like these are so powerful in this deck that we want to run at least four if possible. In general I like to go with the ones that can hit the widest range of creatures but between the lower life totals and lower opponent count in Brawl compared to EDH one can easily justify running something like a Ritual of Soot too. The Landbase The most striking thing about this iteration of Athreos is perhaps his mana cost, which is now double that of his previous form. Hitting land drops for the first five to six turns is imperative in this deck, as our curve is going to be steep and a turn without playing a land could spell doom to an aggressive or midrange deck. Though it may seem excessive, I would recommend running 26-27 lands to diminish the chances of missing a land drop until after we’ve resolved Athreos at least once. Thankfully, our mana base is relatively simple in this two-color deck. The auto-includes should be obvious- anything in Standard that can tap for both black and white is fair game, including of course: We’ll be running a few “color-hungry” cards in this deck as well, so fetch lands like Fabled Passage and Evolving wilds are welcome. I’d argue that even Scoured Barrens and Orzhov Guildgate deserve a spot. The important thing is that we’re hitting a land every turn early on, not necessarily that every land we’re playing is coming in untapped. And while Castle Locthwain may be a worthy include for some much-needed card draw, I’d advise against running utility lands that can’t tap for any color of mana. Field of the Dead may be enough of a menace that you’d want to run Field of Ruin just in case but missing out on that colored mana can come back to haunt you when you’d least expect it. Rest assured, we have other means of dealing with hordes of creatures. Mana Accelerants We want to get our big spells out early in Brawl or some decks will be able to run us over before we can get the ball rolling. For this reason, ramp spells in the 2-4 mana range will be our target: The theme here is ramp spells that do things for us besides just add mana. This deck values a long game with its ability to recur creatures and spells that trade one-for-many. Solemn Simulacrum , already a format staple, ticks off every bonus box for us being a four mana creature that gets us to six mana the following turn in addition to having an ETB and a dies trigger, all qualities Atheros can take advantage of. Orzhov locket is a nice mana sink during long games thanks to our high land count and we need all the card draw we can get given the limited options we have to work with. Altar of the Pantheon is an enigma, at a glance it may seem like a perfect fit for the deck, but after playtesting I found that more often than not it was actually slightly less useful to have enough devotion for Athreos to be a creature. Despite being a great blocker, he becomes vulnerable to much more common forms of removal as a creature. This is not to say that having the extra devotion is a downside necessarily, but I wouldn’t consider it a plus either. Still, Altar only adds a single devotion and the lifegain afforded by it isn’t negligible against aggressive decks so it’s probably still worth the inclusion. Overall it would be more detrimental than anything for us to try and limit ourselves to using permanents with less mana symbols just to try and keep Athreos as an enchantment-only. Creatures and Finishers Creatures with strong ETB and/or dies triggers are going to be quintessential to our success with this deck. Mentioned before, Solemn Simulacrum is a paragon example of what we want to maximize the value of Athreos’ ability when our opponents are running few or low-value creatures. In general we’ll want to keep most of our creatures in the higher CMC range to maximize the value of the coin counters we end up putting on our own creatures. Being able to resolve a boardwipe before any of your creatures even hit the battlefield for the first time is also a great way to roll out the red carpet for them. The on-color Cavaliers both provide fantastic value when recurred multiple times, and Massacre Wurm/Girl are both creatures that will at least partially wipe the board every time they enter the battlefield, which is almost always good for this deck. This isn’t to say that you should discount creatures that aren’t as synergous as the above. There are plenty of creatures that are good enough on their own merits to be worth an include: This article was constructed deliberately to leave some slots in the deck up to the reader. Listed above are some of my favorites that I found when experimenting with the deck. The main similarities between them is that they’re all hefty, evasive creatures that can help us close out a game quickly once they’re in play. Bonus: “Gotchas” I wanted to take a minute to highlight some cards that definitely should NOT be put into this build despite seeming like possibly great additions at first: It truly is a shame how poorly Athreos and his pup synergize with each other. The flavor of Kunoros is great and all but he really doesn’t belong beside his master for the purposes of this deck. Having creatures unable to be recurred by Athreos because Kunoros won’t let them back out of the graveyard after they’ve died is not going to help us win any games. Heartless Act ticks many of the boxes that define a good removal spell but is unable to outright kill any creature with a coin counter on it, making it a terrible choice for this deck specifically. Lastly, Cling to Dust is a superb graveyard hate card but an undeniable part of its draw is its escape ability which we’ll be unlikely to ever activate due to how few cards will accumulate in our graveyard over the course of the game. If things are going well for us hardly any cards will be in our graveyard at all and if they are then Cling or any other escape card in black and white for that matter isn’t going to be the pivot that we need. Eternal Upgrades Athreos shows the potential to shine in Brawl, but what about EDH? Can his powerful synergies keep up with multiple opponents with more life each? Travelling back through older sets reveals to us plenty of cards that would go well with Athreos: Strionic Resonator allows us to double down on our coin counters every turn, giving us more great removal targets and more potential allies after a boardwipe. Ashen Rider proves itself to be an exemplar amongst the many new options we have for value creatures, exiling permanents of our choice both when it enters the battlefield and when it dies. Merciless Eviction , Wrath of God and Austere Command are only a few of many examples of stellar wrath effects sprinkled throughout Magic’s history that we’d want to acquire when upgrading to EDH. Efficient removal is something we don’t see as much in modern Magic as the focus of card creation has shifted from “answers” to “threats” over the years. We want to take advantage of the good answers printed in old sets, the prime examples of which are Swords to Plowshares and Path to Exile . One thing the black and white colors seem to lack in the current Standard is good unconditional card draw, but luckily we can supplement this weakness with cards like Phyrexian Arena and Read the Bones . Finally, Ashnod’s/Phyrexian Altar can allow us to cash out early on creatures we own to potentially get another “enters the battlefield” trigger as well as some much-needed mana to cast our larger spells. Disenchant and Crush Contraband are great cards that would be available for our Brawl build if desired, but where they really shine is in EDH where we have the potential to face much more oppressive artifacts and enchantments than those that exist in Standard. Smothering Tithe embodies exactly this type of oppressive card, it will be an auto-include in many of our opponents’ white EDH decks due to its extremely high ramp value when pitted against multiple foes. Definitely play a copy of your own if you’re able to get your hands on one. Deck(s)list There’s over 25 years of Magic cards to sift through when choosing how to upgrade your Athreos, Shroud-Veiled Brawl deck so try new things and see what works best for your meta! Here’s a full list I put together that I enjoyed playing a lot in one of my playgroups: Full Decklists Plus40 &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;God of Wrath (Brawl &amp; Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/plus40/2020/08/11/athreos_plus40.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;syr carah, and why bolt is playable in every format (commander)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/the%20top%20shelf/2020/08/09/TTS-Mono-Red.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/0/8/080a249a-df47-4769-bb63-0d8ab3f2467c.jpg?1583348244&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Syr Carah, and why bolt is playable in every format (Commander)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oof, what week is it? Why are my shoes gone? Is that a satyr chasing an animated brownie? I tell ya, they know how to party on Eldraine. Anyway, I was supposed to come here and interview one of the ‘Syrs’ for a TTS I think. I feel like I have some notes from when I arrived… Oh yeah! Here we go, &lt;i&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/eld/145/syr-carah-the-bold?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/0/8/080a249a-df47-4769-bb63-0d8ab3f2467c.jpg?1583348244&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Syr Carah, the Bold &lt;/a&gt; Notes:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; The rest of the page appears to be completely blank… So, I guess I’ll go find her to see if she has anything to share about how to build her decks. Mono red would certainly be a challenge… Her ability to exile cards whenever a player is damaged definitely makes more offensive strategies pay off. Generally the combat step is where your damage is done, especially in less competitive pods. For the first build, I would probably go with something like a budget voltron deck. Using Syr Carah’s ability to exile cards as pseudo draw whenever you land an attack, then pairing red’s love of artifacts with powerful equipment could have something going. In a more competitive vein we don’t want to rely on being able to get attacks off. In reality it would be much better to never even need to tap her, given her lack of haste. That has me leaning toward a storm deck, where we can use burn spells to exile a lot of cards at once. A lot of rituals could keep things moving in terms of mana, then you just burn out your opponents with some of the artifact storm cards. Alright, I guess we should start by heading off to see the lady of the hour! The Armory As always I think we’ll be starting with the budget version of the deck. This will run you under $250 and be a great jumping off point for any future voltron decks you want to build. I thought the easiest place to start would be with the damage machine herself, Syr Carah, the Bold , so I got pointed to Carah’s room in the castle. I figured I would find her there, and be done with this article in a hot minute. Turns out, she left. But I did find some cool stuff here that seems to indicate I was on the right track. Her room appears to effectively be just an armory. There’s an Assault Suit sitting in the corner. Passing your commander around the table like this can help stack on commander damage and may even discourage others from killing her. Who doesn’t want a turn to swing the big stick? Hammer of Nazahn is just kinda sitting under her pillow. I can’t imagine it being very comfortable, but I am happy to swerve all the equip costs given that we don’t have a ton of ramp in mono red. Also, there’s a Grafted Exoskeleton sitting in the corner. Which is pretty menacing given its power to oneshot people. In the corner is a box labeled “Do NOT Open”, but I think she wouldn’t care… Well, I’ll be! Looks like our girl was hiding a few swords from us in her secret stash. Sword of the Animist is a great choice. Ramp is always nice to have in a deck without green. Sword of Vengeance gives us trample, which is always good to help bust through token decks and chump blockers. I don’t get what was so special about all this though, there’s only room for one more sword in here and so far I’m not particularly impressed… Sword of Feast and Famine ! This woman realizes we’re on a budget here right? This thing is an absolute power house, but definitely can’t just get tossed around. This card can give you an instant win, so hold out on playing it if you can, but if you find the right way to use it, slam it and take the W. How does she even find the time to put on half this stuff in the middle of battle? Oh look, it’s a little Brass Squire . That thing has to be nice when you’re running a bit low on mana. It can also help snag a piece of equipment one of your underlings was just holding onto for you. Magnetic Theft can do the same, but has the added benefit of letting you borrow someone else’s equipment if you just so happen to be missing your copy of Swiftfoot Boots . It also looks like there was a Treasure Nabber in here earlier too. It dropped off three sol rings and a bunch of artifact ramp we can borrow for a turn. This will help us equip all this and play it out in a timely fashion. Anyway, let’s go back out and look for Syr Carah. Another One Well, her room turned out to be a bust. Let’s head out to the training grounds to take a look for her. I do see a lot of Embereth knights here, but not her. We’ll watch for a while to see if we can figure anything out about how she likes to scrap. Well, I can tell you some of these squires are getting a straight up Savage Beating . Either half of that card can turn a game around and if you entwine it, you’re in for quite the reward. In addition to all the bonus damage you get, Syr Carah, the Bold will flip you four cards off the top for the turn if she manages to hit a player with every attack. Oooh, that’s not even training anymore, that is just Aggravated Assault . When paired with Sword of Feast and Famine from earlier this can give you infinite combat steps, but even without, you can get a lot of value from repeatable extra combat steps. Hellkite Charger falls into a very similar niche both in terms of repeated use and infinite combats. Not quite as permanent, but World at War and Seize the Day do have the chance to get you multiple additional combat steps for the price of a single card. Even if Syr Carah isn’t here let’s take a look at some other soldiers we can include in the deck. Voltron decks are quite weak to targeted removal, so let’s look for some other creatures who can take charge while she waits in the wings. Inferno Titan benefits a lot from extra attack steps, which allow it to blow up some smaller creatures with it’s triggered ability or just beat face even harder. This is one creature we certainly wouldn’t mind lending that Grafted Exoskeleton out to. Plague Myr already has infect, so any of our regular buff equipment will suit it quite nicely. As an added bonus in the early game it can act as a nice mana dork. Like any Infect creature, you should wait to play it out to dodge any potential hate. Finally, Steel Hellkite does great work with all those extra combat step spells allowing us to destroy permanents controlled by all the players we hit this turn. This makes for some very efficient removal on an already scary creature. A Personal Punch This doesn’t quite feel like a Syr Carah deck yet though. Her ability to draw cards is very powerful in red, where actual draw is at a premium. Looking back on what I do remember from my week here, Syr Carah at one point just went off about Rain of Embers and Volcanic Spray , which was weird in the moment, but now I’m glad she talked about it. These let you potentially clear some dorks off the board and flip four more cards off the top to keep the turn going. Price of Progress falls into a similar vein, but can actually deal some serious damage to greedier players. Thankfully it will barely hurt us, if at all, given that we are a mono colored deck. However, we are hoping for most of our activations to come from attacking. In order to clear the way for these attacks, we can make use of cards like Disrupt Decorum and Mob Rule . If our opponents have large enough boards this may even allow us to end the game when combined with a strong swing from our commander. Retracing Our Steps Looking back through everything we’ve learned thus far, we aren’t any closer to actually finding Syr Carah, but we did pretty much reconstruct the first deck for her. The voltron shell is looking strong, so let’s run through your ideal opener then move on to our second deck. In this deck you are going to want to start with 3-5 mana sources in hand. At least two (probably three) of them should be lands. Given how much we are banking on Syr Carah for card advantage, it is going to be important to get her out ASAP. Once she is on the field we’re hoping to land some protection or powerful equipment on her right away. So keeping 1-2 pieces of equipment in your opener can be a great start. We would ideally like to round out our hand with one of our substitute beaters or a burn spell for once Syr Carah is on the field, but this last spot is pretty flexible and might change if you know you’re up against control or aggro mainly. Against aggro we would prefer some removal for their ramp or a way to turn their creatures against them. Against control we should be mulling reasonably hard for a way to ensure Carah can stay on the field for a bit once we play her (e.g. Pyroblast ). The full deck list is below. Onward, to the next deck! Full Decklist A Storm is Brewing This version of the deck is about as high powered as I could get it. On commander tier lists I have seen this commander listed in the same tier as Atla Palani, Nest Tender , our first Top Shelf subject. I feel like she may fall just slightly short, but don’t tell her I said anything. Not that anyone could find her right now to tell her. At this point we’ve searched her quarters, the training ground, and I’m running out of ideas. The last part of the castle left is the basement, so let’s take a look and see if I was right about building it as a storm deck for our more competitive option. Well, at a first glance I’m seeing an Aetherflux Reservoir and a Sentinel Tower . So I think we were right on with that guess. As we try to move through our deck with Syr Carah, the Bold ’s triggered ability, these will help us close out games and kill our opponents. Well, there are plenty of classic storm cards that we can include here, even without the use of blue or other traditional storm colors. Grapeshot is an actual storm card that has huge synergy with Syr Carah. Each of the individual copies will trigger her ability, exiling another card and allowing us to see more of our deck at once. Mizzix’s Mastery and Past in Flames will allow us to recur some of our more potent damage spells as well as the rituals we can use to fuel them. These should be saved for some massive turns where you think you might be able to kill a player or even wipe the table. Bonus Round is another card that should be saved for your all-in turns. However, it can be even more of a gamble as you’re often relying on lucky top decks or Carah exiles to keep you going after you start. This is the main weakness of the deck: sometimes you’re forced to go all-in because your opponents will win given another turn cycle. On Rituals and Reductions Now that I’m looking around more, there’s some sketchy stuff down here. Sure, the giant death machines and powerful spells are spooky, but the guy on Desperate Ritual is freaking me out, I mean just look at his face. It’s a great card for our deck though, so I guess he can stay. Casting this from our hand to ramp out our commander or just ripping it off the top to keep our storm count climbing is going to be worth looking at his mug though. Seething Song is just a grown up version of the ritual, giving us enough mana to cast Syr Carah by itself. There are also a few less traditional rituals we can run too, including Runaway Steam-Kin and Vessel of Volatility . These don’t immediately proffit you mana, but can be used to store up mana for big swing turns. Neheb, the Eternal can be the biggest ritual of all if we are able to land him before passing through combat. The damage we deal in the first half of our turn can all get refunded for hopefully an even bigger second half of the turn. These ritual effects will be great for keeping us going, but we can make that mana stretch a lot further if we reduce the cost of our spells. I’m sure I saw some cool looking artifacts sitting around down here. Ruby Medallion jumps to mind as an easy include. As a mono-red deck we’ll get a lot of mileage out of that one mana reduction. Cloud Key asks us to be a bit more picky about what we are reducing, but it shouldn’t be too hard of a choice. Given how key our commander is, creature is a totally viable choice, but once she’s down I would pretty much always pick instant or sorcery depending on what was in my hand. Helm of Awakening sits at the other end of the spectrum. We’ll reduce the cost on pretty much every card in our deck, but we’ll be doing the same for our opponents. We just have to hope we can capitalize off it better than they can, or that they’re dead by the time our turn is over. BURN BABY BURN You saw the article title, we’re all here for it. There’s Lightning Bolt ’s down here! It can be used as spot removal for a lot of high value creatures or it can be a free cantrip that lets us peek at another card while continuing our burn plan. Fiery Confluence and Skullcrack both have other potential utility, such as getting past damage prevention or clearing key creatures off the board, while still letting us cycle further through our deck. Molten Psyche is a great wheel effect (don’t worry we’ve got the OG Wheel of Fortune in here too) that also deals some pretty healthy damage to our opponents. Plus it highly discourages anyone who might want to play a Notion Thief . Speaking of burn versions of other spells, Mage’s Contest is a whacky counter spell, where you’ll pretty much always win the life bet. Nobody else is running burn spells (hopefully) and other decks are likely to play shocks and use their life total more freely than us. You can even try to push them to the limit of life betting, then back out and just use a Red Elemental Blast instead, you’ll deal a ton of damage and it’ll be hilarious. We don’t want to cast these spells just once though; two spells (like heads) are better than one. Reverberate targeting a Molten Psyche can deal an insane amount of damage, while reloading your hand or just juicing up your Past in Flames . Thankfully, a lot of copy spells are also part of some strong combos. I really enjoy the versatility of combo pieces that also help push your general gameplan forward. So, running Dualcaster Mage is a great way to copy more spells, but alongside Heat Shimmer and Twin Flame it can make infinite hasty 2/2 creatures. These creature copying spells don’t always have to go in the combo, we can use them to make copies of any of our other value generating creatures as well. Increasing Vengeance is another great example of this versatile type of combo. For this combo we need any burn spell, Increasing Vengeance in the yard, and any other copy spell. By casting the burn spell and copying it with Increasing Vengeance , then copying Vengeance we get two copies of Vengeance and two burn spells. We then recopy vengeance and recopy the burn spell and repeat until everyone is dead. Every card in this combo is useful outside of it, which makes it very easy to run. Don’t Mind Us (Please)! Alright, well Syr Carah wasn’t down in the basement either. I’ll finish this up with a mulligan guide then I really gotta figure out what happened last week. This deck, much like our previous one, is all about mana generation. We want to see Syr Carah levels of mana in our opener ideally, but at least 3 repeatable sources of mana could be good enough to hold. Do not, for example, keep an opening with Fire Diamond being your only source of colored mana and just hope to draw mountains. You will get your Fire Diamond destroyed by a trigger happy control player and be very sad. Trust me. After the mana, we’re looking to have a few good burn spells which we can use to start the cycle. The perfect hand would also have an artifact tutor or one of our big artifact payoffs for the storm. Well, here’s the deck list. As always I’ve tossed a few of the possible sideboard options in if you want to tech for your meta. I’ll have to update you with where I found Syr Carah next week… Oh my god, she was passed out in the Assault Suit in her room. And it seems like we got matching tattoos of the Eldraine crest. But there’s… like a third missing? I hope this bender didn’t involve any run-ins with the Ardenvale knights… Full Decklist The Top Shelf &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Syr Carah, and why bolt is playable in every format (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/the%20top%20shelf/2020/08/09/TTS-Mono-Red.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;8/3 huge banlist update&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/breaking%20news/2020/08/03/august03bans.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.magic.wizards.com/images/hero/2018_Daily_WOTC_icon_0.jpg&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;8/3 HUGE Banlist Update&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Breaking News&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKING NEWS&lt;/strong&gt; August 3rd, 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/august-8-2020-banned-and-restricted-announcement&quot;&gt;Banned and Restricted Announcment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Here’s what happened and my takes on the changes… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Standard: Wilderness Reclamation is banned. Teferi, Time Raveler is banned. Growth Spiral is banned. Cauldron Familiar is banned. Wilderness Reclamation has been essentially the defacto best deck in Standard since the last B&amp;R. Reaching above half of the field in tournaments and having been a dominant archetype since it was printed, its time has finally run out. Growth Spiral lies in a similar vein as ramp decks that run this (normally as a four-of) make uo nearly 70% of the metagame in recent tournaments. Ramp has become synonymous with Standard as of late and Growth Spiral is one of the biggest enablers. Axed. With Temur Reclamation as a deck now removed from the format, the other two dominant forces naturally will rise up. Rakdos (and to a lesser extent, Jund) sacrifice decks, which in all variations run some combination of cat/oven are quite resilient and lethal. Removing their go-to interaction is a good way to keep them from becoming dominant. Lastly, Teferi, Time Raveler has been a cause of restriction and frustration since its printing. It’s play patterns are repetitive and completely deny a lot of other strategies or cards from being played. It was the main force holding back Temur Rec from total domination, but with that now gone, there’s no reason for Teferi to stay in the format. Overall, I wish action had been taken sooner, but these are all good choices that strike at the heart of the issue as opposed to tip-toeing around it. I am sad that Cauldron Familiar is gone as I adore Jund Food (and Chev likes Rakdos Sac, that sadist), but they would have been too dominant with the other pillars removed and cat/oven is an annoying (and on Arena, time consuming) synergy. Historic: Teferi, Time Raveler is suspended. Wilderness Reclamation is suspended. Historic has recently been mirroring Standard. For similar reasons as above, Teferi and Reclamation are getting put in time-out like Agent of Treachery , Fires of Invention , etc. before them. Like above, I like this action, especially with no rotation in Historic to remove these cards from the format in another two months. I’m still confused with the purpose and effectiveness of the suspension list, but I would not be surprised if Teferi and Reclamation make their way to being fully banned soon enough. Brawl: Teferi, Time Raveler is banned. Once again, Teferi is just not fun to play against and locks playstyles or cards out of viability. Having constant access to him in a format like Brawl makes this threat omnipresent, and with him making up 10% of the field and having some of the highest win-rates, I have no qualms with him being removed from the format. Pioneer: Inverter of Truth is banned. Kethis, the Hidden Hand is banned. Walking Ballista is banned. Underworld Breach is banned. Pioneer has steadily moved toward Modern levels of degeneracy and this B&amp;R cuts the legs out from the main pillars of the format. Inverter (comboing with Thassa’s Oracle ) is similar to Splinter Twin of Modern’s past, a versatile control deck with an, “Oops, I win,” combo. It is the most popular deck in the format for this and its skill-rewarding play, but this has lead to its synonymy being scorned. Inverter of Truth as a key piece and also lacking redundancy (Thassa’s Oracle can be replaced with Jace, Wielder of Mysteries ) will remove the combo from the format, while preserving the shell it resides in. Underworld Breach is another incredibly powerful and popular deck in the format, foregoing versatility for blistering combo degeneracy. Once again, this deck promotes no interaction and is dagnerously fast. Cutting out it’s enabler, and generally broken namesake, will cripple the combo and make Pioneer ultimately a more healthy format. Kethis combo (oh look, another combo deck) is a small portion of the metagame, but it boasts ridiculous win-rates. Similar to Krark-Clan Ironworks in Modern, this deck is convoluted and extremely hard to pilot, but rewards skill and diligence with wins upon wins. Once again, no complaints from me by removing this swift and deadly combo from the format. Lastly, Walking Ballista fell upon Heliod’s sword. Heliod, Sun-Crowned plus Walking Ballista makes for an early and game-ending two-card combo (I’m sensing a theme here). These decks weren’t necessarily dominant, but they would be the most efficient once the pillars listed above were removed. Ballista can be run in any deck and its potential to be broken is much more varied than Heliod’s, so I can see why it took the fall. Overall, this is a huge mix-up for Pioneer, essentially crippling all the best decks. Once again, similar to Standard, I applaud hitting the issues at the root, there’s no reason for other cool cards to die for broken cards’ sin’s. Slowing down the format and removing the least interactive combos should bring back the players that have been hemmorhaging from the queues. I look forward to seeing how all the new metagames shake out and you can bet that we’ll be covering the brave new worlds emerging! Hit us up on social media and let us know what you think of these bans and what you’re excited to brew now! This is Julian, over and out.

The slang that allows the incredibly complex and growing rules set of MTG to function. Without keywords, we’d be a verbose mess and no one would be able to adequately convey anything about how the game is played or what actions they’re taking. But keywords, over the course of 27 years have grown to be a massive and overflowing bunch as nearly every set brings two or more new mechanics. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; But I don’t want to talk about Companion or Escape in today’s article. I want to throw it back to the most basic of keywords, the bread and butter of casual Magic that are known as ‘evergreen’ mechanics. These are the bread and butter of magic, as creatures were flying over to chip in for damage or trampling over each other long before anyone was counting cards in their graveyard for Undergrowth or tapping mana specifically to trigger Adamant. Today, spurred by the keyword-matters creatures and pseudo keyword lords from Ikoria, I want to focus on three of my favorite keywords: Trample, Menace, and Deathtouch. Let’s dive into a build focused on each of these mechanics with the added benefit that they all completely survive rotation this Fall! Math is for Blockers A great person once said these words, “Math is for blockers. Attack with everything.” That is the exact motto of a board full of creatures with trample. Our creatures are going to be bigger than our opponents, and no matter how they block, we’re going to decimate their forces and crash through for damage anyway. The centerpieces of this deck is the humble bond between a man and his dinosaur. Courtesy of Ikoria, Quartzwood Crasher and Proud Wildbonder . Proud Wildbonder, though taking away our ability to actually destroy creatures in combat, allows us to punch through damage rapidly and efficiently. And then with all that extra damage, Quartzwood Crasher triggers giving us more fat tramplers to block and then smash even more face next turn. But these two best buds want everyone to join in on the fun, which is why they’ve brought along a bunch of beefy friends to help them. Trample creatures generally are above rate so as to make use of the keyword and we have great includes all along our curve. Warden of the Chained is a great body for only three mana and since so many of our creatures are four or more power, he shouldn’t have any issues crashing in. His other 4/4 buddy is Gemrazer who can shut down small flyers or mutate onto pretty much any of our creatures to pick off opposing artifacts and enchantments. Stonecoil Serpent is great as it can fit at any spot in our curve, either as an early way to chip in damage, or as a big stallbreaker when the board gets cluttered. Topping our curve is Thorn Mammoth , a Brawl all-star who hasn’t seen any love in Standard during his tenure since Elraine dropped. Not only does the mammoth have impressive stats, but he comes in swinging and takes out opposing blockers everytime we play another creature. To help ramp into our trunked friend as well as our other creatures, we have Gilded Goose and Ilysian Caryatid , the latter of whom gets even better with our beefed stats. “Now Julian, you can’t possibility expect to solve all your problems just with Trample!” you might say. To which I would say, ”Nonsense!” Even our removal spells have trample! Ram Through and Flame Spill each punch the rest of their damage through to the opponent after removing a blocker or pesky utility creature and are welcome additions to this deck. Add in some Garruk’s Uprising s for card draw and Embercleave , cause it’s Embercleave and we’ve got one buff build! Tramp Stomp Artifacts 2x Embercleave Creatures 3x Gemrazer 2x Gilded Goose 4x Ilysian Caryatid 4x Proud Wildbonder 4x Quartzwood Crasher 3x Stonecoil Serpent 2x Thorn Mammoth 3x Warden of the Chained Enchantments 3x Garruk’s Uprising Instants 2x Flame Spill 4x Ram Through Lands 4x Fabled Passage 9x Forest 7x Mountain 4x Temple of Abandon Menacing the Witness Menace is the “newest” of the keywords we’re discussing today as Wizards has now made this the go-to specific blocking conditions after discarding Fear, Intimidate, etc. Menace is great because it makes our opponent essentially only able to block half of our creatures, makes chump blocking essentially impossible, and sometimes makes our board unblockable if we keep removing their creatures. The powerhouse duo in this build are Sonorous Howlbonder and Labyrinth Raptor ! These two make our creatures incredibly hard to block, let alone trade with favorably (or even unfavorably). Plus our Raptor’s ability will help manage their board from getting out of control and can pump up the creatures they didn’t have enough blockers for. Unlike the trample deck, our menace creatures are fast and low to the ground which helps us curve out and apply pressure quickly. A perfect example that also fuels further draws is Stormfist Crusader . Already a powerful card in Knights’ decks, it shines alongside our other mean muggers. Cavern Whisperer is on the bigger end of our curve, but helps strip our opponent of resources to keep up the onslaught. Grimdancer falls in the middle of the two and can play offense and gain us life or defense and hold back threats with deathtouch To help keep blockers to a minimum and to remove opposing haymakers, we’re running several removal spells. Fire Prophecy and Eliminate are both efficient and we’ve got Blood Curdle s for flavor. We’re also running two excellent creatures who double count as removal: Bonecrusher Giant and Murderous Rider . Though they don’t have menace, their value is undeniable and with Blood Curdle or Call of the Death-Dweller they can gain the buffs from our Howlbonder or Raptor. Call of the Death-Dweller is also key to get back either of our menace ‘lords’ that might have been removed. Mean Muggin’ Artifacts 2x Embercleave Creatures 4x Bonecrusher Giant 3x Grimdancer 4x Labyrinth Raptor 4x Murderous Rider 4x Sonorous Howlbonder 4x Stormfist Crusader Instants 2x Blood Curdle 2x Eliminate 3x Fire Prophecy Sorceries 3x Call of the Death-Dweller 2x Tentative Connection Lands 4x Fabled Passage 7x Mountain 8x Swamp 4x Temple of Malice The Kiss of Death Deathtouch is a rarely used keyword and is usually relegated to small, insignificant creatures (except The Gitrog Monster and Grave Titan ). Used to symbolize the small but deadly creatures that inhabit our own world, it’s primarily a defensive mechanic, great for stalling games with our opponent fearing losing their bomb to our deathtoucher that we’ll gladly make a trade for. On the flipside, deathtouchers can also make great attackers primarily because they are so small and our opponent won’t want to trade to block, that they’ll allow us to chip in turn after turn for a considerable amount of damage. It’s these two angles that we want to maximize in this all deathtoucher’s deck! There isn’t a ‘bonder’ from Ikoria to give a buff to our deathtouch creatures, but M21 gave us something arguably better in Hooded Blightfang . Now, every attack will drain our opponent for one. Add that to the damage from them most likely not blocking and we’re looking at a three or four lifepoint swing per creature! Add on the ability to merc planeswalkers and the Blightfang is a powerhouse. The other extremely notable card in this deck is…. Questing Beast . Yes, I know, we sold out. I don’t like this card either, but as a creature with deathtouch it’s too good to ignore. This will punch in a lot of damage for us and up our clock since most of our creatures are one or 2 power. Speaking of our other creatures, here’s a slew of our rank and file deathtouchers. Fetid Imp can cover the skies either offensively or defensively. Foulmire Knight provides card advantage and/or a cheap venomous body. Grim Dancer (remember them?) and Boot Nipper both are versatile in their uses. Thieves’ Guild Enforcer is new from M21 and provides a pseudo combat trick with its flash. Chevill, Bane of Monsters will provide us card advantage whenever we do need to trade off our creatures or if we use a Ram Through to remove anything pesky. Lastly, Call of the Death-Dweller and a singleton Nethroi, Apex of Death gives us grindability with a few Village Rites to churn through our library. Truly a dangerous deck to tangle with.

Now, I know what you’re thinking and I was the exact same way. “Wait, a card that triggers off of card-draw … but it’s mono green. Chev. Buddy. This is a clear example of what should be in the 59 of someone with a more ‘blue’ persuasion.” And I can see the logic, BUT in this wild wild world we call standard Blue is not the only one drawing cards at ridiculous speeds. In fact, call me a heretic but between Guardian Project , Elder Gargaroth , Return of the Wildspeaker , and Keeper of Fables I would say Green might almost be drawing MORE cards than Blue….No one better tell Julian though, it’ll kill him EDITOR’S NOTE: Julian here. Smh, but it’s true. I’ll save y’all the rant. Basically what I’m saying is, there’s a chance we can build an entire two decks around green’s ability to draw cards and not even miss the islands a little bit. The Game Plan At her core Jolrael wants to be doing two things: making cats and buffing said cats with her mana sink ability. Drawing cards will have a positive effect on both since her buff is tied to cards in hand and will make our tokens. We’ll also include some extra go-wide synergy cards to sweeten the deal. That’s pretty much it! We want to be drawing cards, and we want to be loading up on as many Overrun variants as possible. Cats, Go These are all absolute powerhouses that I’m still not sure Green should have access to. Guardian Project is the most clear-cut draw engine for singleton formats considering we’ll never have more than one creature with a given name, and once it’s down, not only will each creature cast be generating tons of extra value, but Jolrael will be able to drop cats like nobody’s business. The Great Henge benefits us for casting creatures by drawing for each while also being an insanely powerful mana rock. Or more accurately a mana… tree… alien artifact. Lastly, Return of the Wildspeaker is an allstar giving us the option to draw a ton of cards OR as an overrun with our cat army. Either way it plays into our strengths to a tee. Rounding out this cast of characters is Elder Gargaroth , a pushed Green mythic from Core Set 2021 and Beast Whisperer who provides us a third back-up effect for casting creatures and drawing cards. Honestly Green, this is getting out of hand! Cats go Prrrr And what do we do once we’ve amassed so many cats we don’t know what to do with them? Well. We make them really big and we bap our opponent on the nose so violently they concede in a flurry of whiskers. Ideally, we’re using Jolrael’s ability to give everyone +x/+x on a hefty hand, but everyone needs backup. End-Raze Forerunners is like a little Craterhoof Behemoth but with more Boar, and a static +2/+2 with vigilance and trample for our creatures. Feline Sovereign is a cat anthem with a slightly relevant pro-dog clause, but also has a decent artifact or enchantment removal trigger. Overcome is a less mana-restrictive Overrun , but doesn’t provide quite as big a buff as the eternal staple. I’m also really interested to try out Klothys’s Design . While it doesn’t give trample, I feel like the average mono-green board state can put big numbers to our devotion count so I feel like the trade-off is worth giving a chance. Backup Squad At The Hexdrinkers Brawl Battalion we generally like to stay just competitive enough that we’re still able to come out positive, but not so competitive we’re ever restricted in our deckbuilding. That being said, it will always pay to have a suite of top-tier interaction and win-cons for when the going gets rough. Veil of Summer and Heroic Intervention are critical to protecting your creatures, and will give even the most savvy Dimir mages a run for their money. Nissa, Who Shakes the World is an excellent include from a mana perspective, a creatures perspective, and just a casual game-winning perspective. She doesn’t have much to do with cats but sometimes you just gotta beat someone with animated trees. Am I right, Ents? But wait! There’s more! Thaaaaat’s right everyone it’s time for the Commander build. Now, obviously there are cards that could be swapped out of our Brawl baby for a more intense final product but that’s not what this is about, son! We’re talking a straight Brawl DLC! This is like a season pass to all things Jolrael that can just be combined with your existing list for that little extra oomph! We’ll be sticking with the same themes: drawing more than once per turn and going wide, but adding the more powerful older siblings to a lot of our Brawl picks. Add a classic package of protection and removal to round things out. Talk less, Draw More Well, we won’t be causing any confusion about what we’re against or what we’re for, we’re FOR drawing a ridiculous number of cards. We’re AGAINST our opponents being able to do anything about it. The Archive is just absolutely insane. Now, a slightly cheaper draw-only version was just printed for blue ( Teferi’s Ageless Insight ), but feels like Blue can use all the help they can get these days so I ain’t complaining. You go Blue, you’ll get back on top one day. Now Alhammarret doesn’t really get us more cats…at least when used on your turn. It just lets you draw more cards. Get this activated on an opponent’s turn though and we’re seriously cooking. (That’s exactly why we’re packing Endless Atlas in this upgrade package.) Idol of Oblivion probably won’t help us generate any more cats (since it needs a token played that turn to activate), but I think nine turns out of ten it’ll net you an extra card which is still an amazing value for a two mana artifact. Lifecrafter’s Bestiary is essentially a second Guardian Project for a small mana investment, but also lets you scry every turn for whatever you need. (If you’re feeling like a little extra bling, sub this or Idol for Sylvan Library .) Going Bigger So we kind of hinted at this above but remember how End-Raze Forerunners is Something Something lite? WELL GUESS WHO’S HERE!! Boom. Game over. Hulk SMASH. {pics of Triumph of the Hordes, Thunderfoot Baloth, Finale of Devastation} Triumph of the Hordes is one of the more interesting Overrun variants, swapping a larger buff for infect. Even if your opponents groan a little, this is always a good way to end the game. Thunderfoot Baloth stands out in the fact the buff doesn’t actually go away until your commander does which could let you eek out a couple more turns of super buff cats. And then there’s Finale of Devastation . I….I don’t think I ever fully grasped what this card actually did but now that massive price tag makes sense. Not only is it a tutor that can search your graveyard for a game-winning piece but if you’re playing this late enough creatures will get +10/+10 and haste.. There’s a non-zero chance I’m going to be running out and getting a copy as soon as I finish this article. Jeez. Treat Yo Self. So far we’ve kind of stayed in the lanes designated by our Brawl build, but while Brawl is improved by the innovation required by a smaller card pool, Commander really shines due to the sheer volume of synergies available in lanes that haven’t been printed in a while. {pics of Doubling Season, Parallel Lives, Beastmaster Ascension} Doubling Season and Parallel Lives give us double the cats for double the fun, making up for the one-cat-per-turn limit on Jolrael’s army. Beastmaster Ascension has seen a lot of attention recently for just giving a permanent bump to all your creatures once you get it up there. There’s still a few more goodies in there that fit into the above categories or provide some extra flexibility but I’ll let you find them out for yourself, or let me know if I missed anything in the comments!

I would additionally discourage any of you from committing crimes such as mana cheating, ramping without a permit, or attempting to win a game against an Azorious deck. Here to help me speak to this is our honored guest of the week, &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/rna/189/lavinia-azorius-renegade?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/4/c497d496-1232-4614-93b0-9864fa93c29f.jpg?1584831655&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Lavinia, Azorius Renegade &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Lavinia’s high impact passive effect and low casting cost make her a threat right out of the gate. Regardless of the level your table typically plays at there are great options for Lavinia, which makes her perfect for this series. Our budget deck will be up first today, focusing on a combination between group hug and pillow fort strategies. With this we’re hoping to win a resource battle against the last player left. Until then we’ll be encouraging our opponents to bring each other down, while we slowly turtle up. The second deck today will be our high power deck and will focus on locking our opponents out with Omen Machine and Knowledge Pool . Then ends the game by exiling our opponent’s library, or just beating face. Hunker Down and Cuddle Up: As usual, the budget version of the deck should cost you under $200. I know the tapped out says it will be more, but it’s pricing Islands at $2.50. Don’t buy islands for that much, and please report anyone selling them to you at this rate to the Azorius Senate. Anyway, our plan will be to discourage our opponents from attacking us, while giving them the resources to kill each other. When asked for a quote about her commander style Lavinia, Azorius Renegade had the following to say: “I will personally stop those who seek to cheat or gain unfair advantages. I will root them out and crush them under the boot of justice! Their crimes-” Yeah, you get the point. With an attitude like that, we’ll want to see her on the field early and often to stop our opponents from pulling too far ahead of us. We aren’t stopping them from playing cards (yet), we just want to make sure they have all their paperwork in order first. We’ll end the game with cards like Approach of the Second Sun or Tidespout Tyrant . If the need arises we can even borrow some of our opponent’s cards to win the game a la Diluvian Primordial . But in order to get this far in the first place, we’re going to need to get the shields up and stay safe till we feel comfortable entering the fray. Our opponents are going to see Azorius and just immediately put us at target number one. It’s okay, they don’t understand the full glory of blue white. Anyway, when they start to get the lead out, it’s time to pillow up or shut up. Settle in for a Long One: The goal of the pillow fort strategy is to defend yourself by seeming like the worst target possible. If your opponents want to attack you, they’ll have to deal with cards like Propaganda and Ghostly Prison , as well as their big brother Sphere of Safety . If they want to mess with your game plan they’ll need to take it up with Tithe Taker and Unsettled Mariner . Another great defensive card, Illusionist’s Gambit emphasizes the Azorius Senate policy ”Don’t start nothin’, won’t be nothin’”. We can also more actively try to lockdown the game with some cards that pump the breaks on our opponents for whole turns. Lavinia of the Tenth slots into this category well and will allow us to stop opponents from attacking with any of their smaller creatures for a turn. This version of Lavinia’s Detain effect even prevents mana abilities from being activated. One turn lockdowns aren’t going to be enough though, let’s look at some continuous effects that really shut our opponents down. Fatespinner and Angelic Arbiter both force our opponents to decide if they want to cast spells or attack each turn and can be massively disruptive if played correctly. As a bonus if these somehow prevent other players from winning or making big tempo plays, the other folks at the table may even appreciate these cards (don’t count on it though). Lockdown doesn’t always send a strong enough message though, sometimes we need destruction. Karmic Justice answers this call perfectly and reassures our opponents that the Azorius Senate knows how to smash just as well as Gruul, we just have more restraint. Eventually, things will inevitably get out of hand with one of our opponents, so we’ll need to be able to reset them to a position where our taxes and fees will keep us safe. Terminus and Single Combat can help us clear off the board without completely losing everything. Either everything ends up back in people’s decks, ours included, or we get to keep a key creature, like Lavinia, on the board. Tragic Arrogance is a great card to sub in if either of these don’t fit your style. Not every problem requires the nuclear option though, sometimes we can pinpoint a key permanent that is offsetting the balance of things. For that, targeted removal will be our best friend. Winds of Abandon is a great middle ground here, allowing us to either shut it all down, or nail a key target. For our dedicated single target removal, we still like that idea of keeping the balance. Generous Gift lets someone keep a blocker, but can remove any permanent that we believe is problematic for us. Fractured Identity leans in the other direction. If someone pulls out way ahead by dropping a game ending creature, just teach them that sharing is caring and spread that wealth around the table. One last card I want to highlight is Oblation which is still great removal, but also hints toward the other archetype we’re mixing into this deck, Group Hug. EDH Politics 101: Group hug is another strategy that tries to push the aggression off of you. But this time it does so by giving the other players resources and playing symmetrical effects. You can usually negotiate your way out of any early aggression using these effects. Later, you might be able to exchange some of that goodwill for help on cards like Fact or Fiction and Truth or Tale . If you really trust another player, you could even pull off a big Epiphany at the Drownyard . Some great creatures that fit into this game plan are Kami of the Crescent Moon , Orzhov Advokist , and even Jace’s Archivist . These cards initially appear weak because you’re spending a card, but everyone gets the same benefit as you. The key here comes with finding ways to break this parity. For Jace’s Archivist this can come from causing your opponent’s to discard key cards while giving you a free reload. While with Kami of the Crescent Moon we are hoping to spend less cards getting to the late game than our opponents, so we’ll be profiting more from each draw. There are a lot of different ways to manipulate or control the group’s opinion of you. You can play cards that buff their creatures specifically but ensure you aren’t at risk, like Martial Impetus or Vow of Flight . Alternatively you can let them decide how your cards play out, even though it usually just does what you wanted, using Will of the council cards. Two perfect examples of this are Split Decision and Council’s Judgment . Sometimes you just want to give out resources to remind people you’re everyone’s best friend. Minds Aglow , Otherworld Atlas , and Temple Bell will help you keep people’s hands full and keep them happy with you. It doesn’t hurt to ensure that your Recurring Insight will always net you a full hand either. At its heart this is still a control deck that will take some good thinking to pilot well. So, make sure to keep an eye on players’ resources and know when to be giving out handouts versus when to lay down the law. Starting Your Political Career: This is a new section I’ll be adding to each of these articles, where I give a brief rundown on how to identify a good starting hand and how to make use of it. For this deck we don’t really have any ramp outside of a few artifacts and our average CMC is a bit high. So, we’ll be looking for three to four mana sources in our starting hand. This will ensure that even if we don’t see lands for a little while we can keep playing on curve. After that, make sure that you have one or two cards that can help keep you safe in the short term. These could come from the Pillow Fort or the Group Hug category, we just want a way to put the shields up early. After that we will be looking for either draw or a long term plan. If we can find a consistent draw engine we’ll be well stocked with resources into the midgame. If we have one of our win cons or another high value spell we can try to politic our way into making that as high impact as possible. Take a look below for the full decklist with a small sideboard of other cards you may want to include. Full Decklist The True Glory of Azorius Now that I’ve served half my sentence.. Uh I mean, now that I’m halfway done with my volunteer work, onto the second deck of this article! This second deck isn’t meant to lock down the first time mana-cheating offenders, this deck is meant to lay down the law against the serious rule breakers. We won’t be doing any hugging and there certainly won’t be any pillows, this is going to be full blown Lavinia, Azorius Renegade cruel control with a lockout win condition. Based on her effect, if we land Omen Machine or Knowledge Pool and have Lavinia on the board we will either prevent our opponents from ever casting another spell or prevent them from ever drawing another card. This is a relatively hard lock, but can still be picked if we don’t have some counter magic or removal ready for a few of the cheeky work arounds. Once we have our opponents shut out we can clean up the table in a few different ways if our opponents don’t concede. Jace, the Mind Sculptor should be able to safely get off his ultimate at this point, which will easily secure us the win as we go around the table removing everyone from the game. Helm of Obedience and Rest in Peace will allow us to do the same thing, again one player at a time. As a bonus, Rest in Peace is just a good stax card that we can play out as we feel necessary. Finally, we could always just slowly beat them to death with our creatures, regardless of how small they may be. Throw the Book at Them: Given that we are trying to win the game by playing our commander, a six mana artifact, and we want to keep some mana open for counter magic, we will not be the quickest deck at the table. So, we need to control the flow of the game until then. Mana Breach , Damping Sphere , and Winter Orb should help us prevent our opponents from ramping too hard or getting out in front of us from a resource perspective. Juntu Stakes will also help us keep our opponents mana dorks down without hurting our game plan. We’ll be running some cool planeswalkers to help keep our opponents from winning as well. Gideon of the Trials literally says that they can’t win the game while he or another beefcake is around. This is perfect for stopping a Thassa’s Oracle or Laboratory Maniac win. On top of these other cards, Narset, Parter of Veils and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria can do a lot to slow down our opponents. We also have plenty of creatures that we can use to help lock down our opponents. Alms Collector offers you a slightly worse Notion Thief without needing access to black mana. Card draw in white is hard to come by, so I’m always happy to borrow some from the other players at the table. Drannith Magistrate is a relatively new card that will do great work for us. It works similar to our commander for either of our locks, or can function as an early stax piece. Linvala, Keeper of Silence and Hushbringer both help us lock out creature abilities and win conditions, which can be very important depending on the metagame at your table. Finally, Nimble Obstructionist is an uncounterable Stifle that draws us a card. As a control deck, we are obviously going to be running a healthy amount of counterspells and removal. Baral, Chief of Compliance will help us get these spells out and reward us for successfully countering any of our opponent’s nasty ideas. Fierce Guardianship will help us prevent anyone from messing up the lock, ideally for free if Lavinia is already on the board. Pact of Negation won’t punish us too badly because in theory we are free to waste five mana the turn after our lockdown goes into place. Delay and Ertai’s Meddling allow us to delay a spell, then counter it with Lavinia, Azorius Renegade or Drannith Magistrate . Chain of Vapor will help encourage our opponents to hurt each other and themselves while still being functional removal. Even if this gets turned back on us, we’ll end up getting more benefit out of it because we suffer less when removing our lands. Speaking of removing lands, Armageddon and Cataclysm will both make appearances in this deck. You may wonder if I’m running Ravages of War ; I’m not. In my opinion there are good ways to spend $150 improving your deck and bad ways to do it. Including that card over another one of our spells wouldn’t dramatically change our win rate and could even reduce it depending on the meta. It’s not worth it. The Keys to the Kingdom: The final element of this deck I want to highlight is the cards that help us in the resource battle. As a control deck we are often trading down, going one for one with different opponents. Our stax pieces will help slow down the other players at the table, but that’s still not enough. Smothering Tithe and Land Tax will help us stay in the game from a mana perspective. As other players ramp or draw, we will naturally generate resources off their cards. Shoutout to Tithe which can also help snag us some lands. Rhystic Study and Mystic Remora fall into the same category, but instead help us keep our hand full of spells that can impact the game. Mangara the Diplomat also keeps our hand full, but instead comes on a reasonable body for a similar cost. Windfall can also be used to reset our hand after we’re low on resources and cause our opponents to discard some of their high value cards. This move is particularly effective if anyone else at the table has been tutoring a lot or you suspect they may go for the win next turn. Speaking of tutors, we can’t just rely on draw to find our lock cards. Treasure Mage happens to hit both Omen Machine and Knowledge Pool , which works perfectly for us. Enlightened Tutor is a classic for strategies like ours. As a nice cherry on top it also works as a way to find key stax pieces or other important cards before we’re ready to win. Mystical Tutor can’t grab either of our artifacts, but can hit any of our other tutors as well as removal or counter magic. Finally, Whir of Invention works very well with all the artifacts we’re running and allows us to tutor either of our lock cards straight to the field. I AM THE SENATE: In this version of the deck we have a lower CMC and a lot of artifact ramp. I would still look for three mana sources or fetch lands, but place a stronger emphasis on having some amount of artifact ramp in the hand. Once you’re comfortable with that, we need to have some early counter magic. Other players are going to start looking for the win as soon as their first turn, so we need to be ready to stop them. In the same vein we’ll need one or two of our early stax pieces to deny our opponents the ability to look for that early win. Finally, resource generation is still important. Once we’ve blown through our opening hand, which will be very fast, we need to be able to reload and keep up the pressure. In conclusion, you’re priorities in order are: The full deck list is given below. Well, now that I am done with my volunteer work I think I’m gonna hop off this plane for a bit. Maybe take a tour of Eldraine. I heard Syr something or other was hosting a party and those are always a fun time. See you next week!

This week we will be dipping back into the well of commander precons. &lt;em&gt;C20&lt;/em&gt; featured the return of &lt;em&gt;Partners with&lt;/em&gt;, a mechanic I found very interesting and was happy to see again. I think that &lt;em&gt;Partners with&lt;/em&gt; outshines the original &lt;em&gt;Partners&lt;/em&gt; mechanic because it allows the design team to build in bespoke synergies or game plans with a lower risk of accidentally creating something overpowered. In an effort to branch out from my comfort colors of Naya, I’ll be looking at a Sultai deck this week! (I won’t give up green, you can’t make me. I have rights!)&lt;/p&gt; Cazur, Ruthless Stalker and Ukkima, Stalking Shadow are great partners, where the synergy immediately jumps out at you. Swing in with Ukkima to get buffs from Cazur and quickly snowball into a commander damage win or burn for a bunch when your whale wolf leaves the battlefield. In this article we will be exploring a build that falls into this high synergy, partner focused, category and a very interesting competitive take utilizing Food Chain combos. The Power to Bite Let’s jump into our budget list first. The deck should run you under $200 and offer a well-tuned gameplan. It will focus on beefing up Ukkima, Stalking Shadow to land powerful hits and to punish our opponents for removing him. We want Ukkima’s growth to be permanent, so we are going to be focusing mainly on +1/+1 counters as opposed to combat tricks and temporary buffs. When building this deck, my mind immediately jumped to cards like Hardened Scales , Winding Constrictor , and Corpsejack Menace . These cards will give us significant incremental growth to bolster the counters we are already building up on Ukkima. Strategies that rely on counters always love Proliferate, so we can toss in Thrummingbird and Inexorable Tide as well. Finally, I always find it helpful to sometimes just win the game, so let’s have Simic Ascendancy as our cherry on top. There are a few all-star cards when it comes to +1/+1 counters we get to include that I’m very excited about. Reyhan, Last of the Abzan is great at saving the counters from our dying creatures and getting them back on Ukkima where they belong. Forgotten Ancient also does a great job of sharing the wealth of +1/+1 counters, eventually funneling them onto our favorite Whale Wolf. Vorel of the Hull Clade and Hydra’s Growth let us stomp on the gas and kill our opponents much faster by just doubling the counters on Ukkima. Speaking of killing our opponents quickly… Don’t tell anyone I told you, but Tainted Strike is super gross in this deck and you should absolutely run it. I can’t say it’ll win you friends but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t win games. Now that Ukkima is big, we’ve painted a target on our backs. People will try to lock him down but may be careful about killing him for fear of the damage he’ll do when he dies. I expect to see a fair amount of hate aimed at us as soon as Ukkima’s any larger than 6/6. We can always try to prevent his destruction, but then we have to go through the whole rigmarole that is the commander tax and dodging counterspells. Instead let’s just swerve that and blink that boi! Displace and Ghostly Flicker are spells that will help us save Ukkima and Cazur from any targeted removal. Evacuation and Flood of Tears act as the nuclear option, allowing us to fully reset the board, sometimes we even get to put Ukkima or another key creature right back into play. Under the Sea: Darlin blue’s better, down where it’s wetter, take it from me! Let’s talk draw. In our last Top Shelf article we were relying on green to move through our deck… Spoiler: that’s not very good. In this deck we’ll still be looking to green for cards like Greater Good to help with drawing cards, but now that we have blue and black a lot of new doors are open to us. Cold-Eyed Selkie and Edric, Spymaster of Trest will work very well with Cazur, Ruthless Stalker , allowing us to get more benefits from our attacks and draw some cards. Mystic Remora , also known as THE FISH, will be a great draw tool for us. You’ll never get tired of interrupting your friends with “You gonna pay four for that?” (Another spoiler: they probably won’t be paying four) Of One Mind and Treasure Cruise let you draw multiple cards for one mana in a lot of situations, which is really gonna help us find our powerful cards. Finally, shoutout to Tezzeret’s Gambit for being a totally fine draw spell that also gives us more proliferate. Read the Bones is a classic example of Black’s style of draw, turning in some small portion of your life for resources. Sign in Blood and Night’s Whisper are both similar draw options, so we’ll be running both of those as well. When we combine black with blue we get some unique draw adjacent effects. Fallen Shinobi and Mythos of Brokkos are great examples of resource generation that don’t necessarily fit into the category of draw. Now that we can move through our deck even faster, we want a lot of mana to play as many of these awesome cards as quickly as possible. There’s not a ton of unique ramp in here so I’ll keep this quick. We’re gonna run a standard set of mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic as a baseline. Then drop in a nice mix of ramp sorceries. Migration Path is a nice new ramp spell, but who could forget the classics such as Kodama’s Reach and Cultivate . We’ll put all of ‘em in just to be safe. Spells like this are actually going to work really well with Evolution Sage to keep those counters growing. Hunting Tactics: So, we have our battle plan and our pack (pod? pock? We’ll stick with pack) behind us. Now let’s start circling in for the kill. Blue and black are going to give us the ability to easily disrupt our opponent’s game plan as we are working on our own. Counterspell is the OG, but Arcane Denial is a personal favorite. Conditional counterspells and removal are often a great include. It’s pretty easy to find options where either the condition is easy to manipulate or accidentally achieve. Drown in the Loch is a great card in this category. Finally, cards like Putrefy and Beast Within will help us clear out any final permanents stopping Ukkima from going in for the kill. That’s the full story for our first deck. As usual I’ve included some options that you may want to toss in from the maybe board depending on your preference or meta. Take a look at the full list below and let’s head onto our next deck! Full Decklist In R’lyeh We Wait Dreaming Now, the competitive version of this deck is much better known than the Atla Palani, Nest Tender deck from last week, but I’m still excited to give my take on it. As I mentioned earlier, we’re going to be mainly looking for a Food Chain combo to win the game. Eternal Scourge and Misthollow Griffin are both able to be cast from exile after they’re banished to the shadow realm via Food Chain . This will allow us to generate one additional colored mana (which can only be spent on creatures) each time we go through the loop. Repeat said loop an infinite amount of times and Boom! infinite mana! This will allow us to repeatedly cast, Ukkima, Stalking Shadow , who when exiled or returned to the command zone is able to damage equal to his power. So we’ll be looking to end most games by spending our infinite mana casting and exiling him over and over again, wiping the table. I personally do not like Thassa’s Oracle . I think Demonic Consultation and Tainted Pact wins with this card are far too generic and easy to pull off in any UBX shell, BUT! This is one of those UBX shells, so we’ll be running them and I’ll find another time or article to offer my full opinion on this. Jace, Wielder of Mysteries will act as a nice backup to the Oracle. If you happen to feel the same as me, it’s actually really easy to swap out these four cards with Deadeye Navigator , Peregrine Drake , and Palinchron . This also eliminates the need for a singleton manabase, which can help cut down on deck cost. In this version we just create infinite mana then blink Ukkima for the win, instead of exiling him with Food Chain . On the Hunt… For Our Combo Now that we know how to win with this version of the deck, let’s sniff out those combo pieces. Standard black and blue draw are going to help us build a solid foundation to find the cards we’re looking for. Necropotence and Notion Thief will be able to hopefully allow us to draw a lot of cards at once. While we’ll be running some of the more ubiquitous draw spells, like Ponder , Brainstorm , and other cantrips, we get to run some very weird cards that border on being tutors because we are a Food Chain deck. Foresight and Manipulate Fate let us pre-exile either Eternal Scourge or Misthollow Griffin . Extract will also enable our Food Chain combos, but can be used to remove key combo pieces from your opponent’s decks if it comes to it. There are more cards that ride this line between tutoring and drawing cards. Lim-Dul’s Vault and Plunge Into Darkness will allow us to seek specific combo pieces or key cards we need in a moment. These cards are very powerful, but if you play in a meta where chip damage and life total is relevant they should probably be used as a last resort to either lock in your win or stop someone else’s. Almost all of our tutors will be split between those that only find creatures and those that can help us find anything we’d like. Worldly Tutor and Neoform will help us find our creature based win-conditions, but generic tutors can help find those as well. Grim Tutor , Demonic Tutor , and Vampiric Tutor are all going to be awesome for us. We can hunt down any card we need pretty cheaply and efficiently. Cazur is Still Here… Kinda Unlike the more casual version of the deck, Cazur is probably not going to be in play much. He does offer his friend Ukkima certain benefits though, if you know what I mean… Yeah, I’m talking about green ramp. We’ll be stuffing our deck to the gills with mana dorks and other spells to speed up our curve. Bloom Tender and Arbor Elf are often great choices for multi colored decks, as they can generate multiple mana and/or multiple colors of mana. Wall of Roots and Elvish Spirit Guide are great for generating mana quickly and immediately if the need arises. Alternatively, Deathrite Shaman exile key cards from our opponents’ graveyards, potentially even saving a game, when we aren’t using it for mana. For non-creature based mana sources, Carpet of Flowers is still just as good as it was last week. The list of mana artifacts we’ll be running is the same as last week. I’ll be looking more into cool artifacts and artifact focused decks in the future, but for right now I’m not a big enough expert to make any hot takes. To be clear, Cazur isn’t just in the deck to activate our ramp cards. He also turns on some of our powerful interaction spells. Abrupt Decay and Assassin’s Trophy are great removal tools in the deck, that Cazur can brag wouldn’t be around if it weren’t for him. We can also enjoy tilting our friends who play standard with Veil of Summer and it’s slightly less cool cousin Autumn’s Veil . As nice as it is that Cazur is here to hang out, let’s just have another round of applause for Ukkima allowing us to run the powerful counterspells and tech cards in UB. Your Opponents Trying to Win? Just Say No. Counterspells are one of the most powerful tools in magic. “Counter target spell” is up there for the three best words to put on a card. So let’s take a look at some of the best counterspells for the format, the ones you don’t even have to spend mana on! Force of Negation is unbelievably powerful, while hitting the wallet a bit more gently than Force of Will . If you have both, I would absolutely suggest running them in tandem but I’ll be sticking with Negation. Speaking of negation, Pact of Negation is great for winning the game, when there won’t be a next turn. Narset’s Reversal can also help lock in a win by potentially stealing your opponent’s tutor or game winning spell. Even just a slight tax from cards like Miscast , Spell Pierce or Flusterstorm can help stop a lot of wins where your opponent has exact mana. Finally, I just want to offer a quick blurb about some fun (for us, not for our opponents) cards I’ve made room for in this deck. Narset, Parter of Veils is the first card that pops into my head as this girl is rude. Remember Leovold, Emissary of Trest ? This has the same unbelievably cursed effect and dodges creature specific removal. Is your opponent looking for a win out of the yard? Maybe they’re about to resurrect Razaketh the Foulblooded before you’ve even had a turn? Faerie Macabre is here to help you shut that down. One last option I’ve thrown in is Gilded Drake . This is a highly meta-dependent call. I run into a fair amount of hatebears, value generating creatures, and other problematic things that this helps address. There have been some other meta-dependent or potentially budget-busting cards I’ve called out here so there’s a pretty big maybeboard for this deck. Take a look at it and see if there are any cards you think you’d rather include. The full list is below. Full Decklist Alright! That’s all folks! Thanks a ton for reading through this article. I wish you good luck and happy hunting with either of these decks. If you have any commander’s you’d like to see me go over in future articles like this, let me know in the comments or on Hexdrinkers Twitter. Next week I’ll be going over yet another Naya commander, as it is the best color combination… Hold on, I think I hear someone ringing The Hexdrinkers doorbell. Looks like the Azorius Senate. I’ll deal with these schmucks and get back to you as soon as I can.

I know, I know. It’s been a while but I promise between &lt;em&gt;M21&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jumpstart,&lt;/em&gt; the time for Brawl has never been better. With Wizards announcing recently that Brawl will now be available every day for &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; and Historic Brawl seeing a little more attention from the big guys upstairs, we are truly living in a Golden Age. It does bring up the question of will we still be seeing powerful old legends backfilled into the format like we did in the Guildhalls. For now I’m going to revel in the ability to play my favorite format every day!&lt;/p&gt; So, let’s celebrate the only way I know how… brewing a new deck chock full synergy, power, and a dash of ruthlessness. I’m about to make a deck you can’t refuse… My family has finally gotten around to watching the Corleone crime saga and if nothing else is bringing us together in Quarantine, it’s Michael cleaning house of the snitches and hooligans that have tried to have him and his family killed. As Godfather he continues to create a crime empire that spans the country and knows no rivals. That might be a little out of scope for a deck build, but here at Hexdrinkers world domination is never far from our mind…instead we’ll focus on Michael’s inspiration for his long lasting empire! Nothing Al Pacino does would be possible without the foundation laid by his father, Vito. Core Set 2021 Introduced us to Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose and lemme tell ya, I’m impressed. Taking a classic Magic enchantment like Sanguine Bond , throwing it on a stick for two mana less is great. With the right crew, I don’t think it’ll take much to reach Vito’s maximum potential and before long our opponents will be sleeping with the fishes. One for Me, Two For You Ah pinging, the shin-kicks of Magic. Always annoying and not lethal by itself but still capable of inflicting a serious amount of damage. With Vito out, that trouble is doubled. Think of these guys as the street level enforcers. For each life gained, we’ll be dealing more damage directly to our opponents, essentially halving their clock with one of these repeatable engines on the board. Ill-Gotten Inheritance was a draft all star, ending games if you didn’t have an answer. While it’s a little slow for Standard, it fits just perfectly into our Vito shell. Add on the sac ability to potentially deal eight damage to our opponent?? This card should definitely not be taken lightly. Ayara, First of Locthwain joins forces with Syr Konrad, the Grim to just hammer our opponents for any creature entering the battlefield, leaving the battlefield, never reaching the battlefield. No matter what any other creature is doing - it’ll bring the pain to whoever is on the other side of the table. Dread Presence requires a couple land drops, but for the ability to deal two-to-four damage per turn outside of combat, this is not a hard condition to meet. Also, if Vito is currently unavailable - locked in his office listening to the plea of a fishmonger (since no Sicilian can deny a request on his daughter’s wedding day), Dread Presence can be drawing you an extra card per turn Phyrexian Arena style. It’s incredibly versatile. Okay, okay hear me out on Tavern Swindler . In most decks, terrible. In the long run you’ll be gaining just as much life as you’re losing and the odds just aren’t worth it. But, but, in a deck that capitalizes on the mere act of gaining life this card is pretty buckwild. Consider the average of gaining six life every other turn, now consider that with Vito on the board. We’re going to be dealing six damage directly to our opponents on a fairly regular basis without even attacking! Even if it takes us a few turns to start the pain train, this deck sports enough life gain to make the sacrifice worth it. …And of course in some games, you’ll be hitting your opponent for sixevery turn. Editor’s note: This is coming from a guy who runs Okaun, Eye of Chaos and Zndrsplt, Eye of Wisdom in Commander so keep an eye on his coin flipping. Throw in copies of Serrated Scorpion , Bastion of Remembrance , and Sanctum of Stone Fangs for pinging redundancy and I’d be surprised if our opponent can escape ankles un-shanked. The Bosses Pinging is all well and good, but things really start getting scary when we’re gaining lots of life on purpose. Primarily, this means creatures with lifelink swinging in or making use of Vito’s secondary ability. Murderous Rider certainly needs no introduction. As non-conditional creature and planeswalker removal at a decent price, there’s not a black deck that wouldn’t run this card. Throw in the fact that this 2/3 could be dealing four combined damage a turn and it’s all upside. Every self-respecting crime organization needs a hitman. Cavalier of Night is more conditional to activate it’s powerful destroy trigger, but at the end of the day it’s still a 4/5 with lifelink swinging for a potential eight each turn and a recursion ability that can get us back Murderous Rider , Grim Dancer , or even a Vampire of the Dire Moon . The Haunt of Hightower , the often overlooked Buy-A-Box promo for Ravnica Allegiance is a weird, but I assure you this vampire can put in some serious work. If your opponent values their life, they cannot let this live. The Haunt will continue to grow each turn with more and more life gained as your opponent loses all their cards. If nothing else, this card will immediately lure any removal your opponent has out of the woodwork. And ya know…the more I look at it, the more I feel like this card is the nega- Dream Trawler … I don’t think we’d be too far off to include Dreadhorde Invasion and Duskfang Mentor either. While not as flashy as the other lifelinkers, the support is very much appreciated. Obliteration All good things must eventually come to an end, and our games are no exception. After a while, it becomes tiring playing with our opponent’s life total, toying with them, and now it’s time to deal the killing blow. But where do we look for a card that could gain us an obscene amount of life to deal that much damage to our opponents?? I don’t know what Asphodel’s got going on, but it’s straight up scary when Vito comes to town. Our other main win-con is Erebos’s Intervention which trades devotion for paying mana, but we don’t get to hit twice. For consistency, we’ll include a Grim Tutor (which costs a single wild card! Booyah!!), and some other powerful black cards like Massacre Wurm just to cover our bases. 90% of the time, Vito will pull through. The other 10% we throw a giant wurm at ‘em and hope for the best. In Conclusion So there you have it! Whether you want to start your own criminal empire, or just drive your opponents into a rage with every life gained - Vito is your guy. A low cost commander who can enter the board quick and immediately start pulling his weight with the first Radiant Fountain . In an initial run, Vito went 3-2 with losses to Yarok, the Desecrated and a Thassa, Deep-Dwelling / Agent of Treachery soft-lock. Wins against Niv-Mizzet, Reborn , Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy , and Illuna, Apex of Wishes have me feeling pretty confident in the power level of this deck before any fine-tuning. Some things to keep in note though: you always, always want to start with a low-cost lifelinker in your hand. Being able to drop a Boot Nipper or Grimdancer early is vital for success in ramping up the damage by the time your opponent is able to respond. I’d also really consider getting a Grim Tutor if you want to play this deck or anything mono-black in general. The sheer versatility to grab either of our finishers or a removal spell is key, and directly responsible for our Kinnan win by being able to fetch Gray Merchant of Asphodel . That’s it for this brew! If you think I’m missing anything, or you’ve had more Vito success, let us know below!

Welcome back to another installment of &lt;em&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/em&gt;, our first for &lt;em&gt;Core 21&lt;/em&gt;. This new core set is an absolute treasure trove for all sorts of formats and playstyles and it contains several enchantments that could become our titular engines. When deciding on what to brew around I considered obvious standouts like &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/m21/28/nine-lives?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/7/e70b7a73-484e-48f1-944c-3d38866cdc20.jpg?1592760676&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Nine Lives &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/m21/142/double-vision?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/7/5/754b77b4-4cc4-4e49-a7a4-667401e7e063.jpg?1592761301&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Double Vision &lt;/a&gt;, or even the Shrine cycle (these aren’t out of the running though, so … stay tuned). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; But ultimately, I decided on a card that no one was talking about. A card that spoke to my simplest and purest form of playstyle: Griffin Aerie . A humble and overlooked uncommon, Griffin Aerie is simple yet efficient in its design and it almost epitomizes what I want to do in Magic. At two mana, it can come down early and isn’t a big investment that sets us back if it quickly gets removed or bounced (cough cough Offspring’s Revenge cough cough). It doesn’t have any activated abilities, just a singular sentence detailing a simple requirement with a simple payoff: you gain three life on your turn, we’ll let you enlist a feathered friend from our aerie. Griffin Aerie isn’t a card that’s over the top, and its condition isn’t insurmountable. It’s fairly easy to trigger just by engaging in combat with lifelink or playing spells that have incidental lifegain, several of which exist in Standard. In return, the payoff is moderate. A 2/2 with flying is pretty good, but it’s nothing ridiculous and it’s hard to truly abuse. Griffin Aerie is a card that sits there and allows you to play like normal and given some deckbuilding considerations will provide a fat stack of advantage over the course of the game. Beautiful. You Only Live Thrice So we already have our rough gameplan: gain at least three life a turn and that will keep us alive while we beat face with an army of eagle-lion-things, more commonly known as griffins. Currently in Standard there are a surprising number of cards that gain us exactly three life. Revitalize , Healer of the Glade , and Ajani, the Greathearted are all options that hit that sweet spot. But what’s even more surprising is how many of these are good. Why settle for these when you could have Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath ? Exactly. Other cards that have seen significant play already include Absorb as a good answer to haymakers or anything with an ETB and Knight of Autumn which has a mode for every situation. We’re comfortably in Bant with these picks and other cards like Elite Guardmage scratch that sweet spot for my value loving brain, but believe it or not, we can also branch in black to find spicier picks. Basilica Bell Haunt, one of the stars of the Offspring’s Revenge article, helps strip our opponent of resources so they can’t defend against our griffin army. If we were playing knights, a Blacklance Paragon (begrudgingly cast during main phase one) is an option. In a mill deck, Creeping Chill would be a star player. Spoiler: we aren’t playing either of those, but they are a route you could go down just to show the versatility of the aerie. Even a personal Eldraine favorite, Clackbridge Troll can trigger our aerie. And if it isn’t, we’re smashing for eight which is just as acceptable. Between the troll and Indulging Patrician , a card perfectly tailored to back up our army of griffins, we’ll be doling out quite the beatdown while brimming with life. Another One As DJ Khaled said, we want another one; another three life, another griffin, all of the above. Since a lot of our lifegain comes in the form of ETBs, this deck is perfect for the host of blink and bounce effects in Standard right now. Thassa, Deep-Dwelling is the go-to for recurring ETBs. Formerly a force of evil who would endlessly trigger Agent of Treachery , she’ll now be blinking our Bell-Haunts and Guardmages to bring us that sweet, sweet value. Her best friend is Charming Prince who already gains us the three life we need right off the bat, but can also help us find our pieces as well as blink something else himself, such as a Guardmage to draw us an additional card. Two more new Core 21 cards to keep the griffin trail rolling are Niambi, Esteemed Speaker and Barrin, Tolarian Archmage . At home alongside Teferi, Time Raveler both in function and lore, these can both bounce our creatures (with upside!) so we can cast them again for maximum griffins. Barrin will get us an additional card if we bounce our own things or he can just as easily give us tempo advantage by bouncing a flying blocker. Niyambi will gain us the life we need if we bounce something, easy griffins. Ten Points to Gryffindor Companion Yorion, Sky Nomad Creatures 3x Barrin, Tolarian Archmage 4x Charming Prince 4x Elite Guardmage 3x Knight of Autumn 3x Niambi, Esteemed Speaker 4x Thassa, Deep-Dwelling 4x Uro, Titan of Nature&#39;s Wrath 2x Yorion, Sky Nomad Enchantments 4x Griffin Aerie Instants 3x Absorb 3x Growth Spiral 2x Lofty Denial 3x Revitalize Planeswalkers 1x Ajani, Great-Hearted 4x Teferi, Time Raveler Lands 4x Breeding Pool 4x Fabled Passage 5x Forest 4x Hallowed Fountain 6x Island 6x Plains 4x Temple Garden This Bant list does a lot of cool things and plays a lot of powerful cards, but during my research I thought I would be remiss if I didn’t give a second take. Black has such a deep pool as we discussed earlier and would provide a different play experience. Plus some of my favorite cards from the research phases are in black and I need to show them some love. This version of the deck relies much less on blinking and bouncing, forgoing that for more grindy cards with more removal and resource denial. I also liked experimenting with more one- and two-of’s to provide consistently new play patterns as well as try out some sweet cards (like Chevill, Bane of Monsters , my co-founder). Slam Dunk in that Aerie, Call Me Blake Griffin Creatures 3x Basilica Bell-Haunt 4x Charming Prince 1x Chevill, Bane of Monsters 3x Clackbridge Troll 1x Elder Gargaroth 4x Indulging Patrician 2x Knight of Autumn 2x Scavenging Ooze Enchantments 2x Dawn of Hope 1x Ethereal Absolution 4x Griffin Aerie Instants 3x Dire Tactics 3x Eliminate 2x Erebos&#39;s Intervention Sorceries 1x Sanguine Indulgence Lands 4x Fabled Passage 2x Forest 4x Godless Shrine 3x Overgrown Tomb 4x Plains 4x Swamp 3x Temple Garden And that wraps up this installment of Rev Your Engines, I hope you’ll be flying high trying this deck out. Remember not to overlook the less flashy cards as often they can be great centerpieces as well and really force you to be creative in deckbuilding.

So we’ve got a bit of a different article set-up for you today. In an effort to promote the differences between our deck-building and theory-crafting, we’ve decided to put together a brand new series called &lt;em&gt;DUEL DECKS&lt;/em&gt;! Basically, we’ll be picking up the slack for Wizards who dropped the classic Duel Decks line a couple years ago with our own crazy builds featuring the best of match-ups. To start things off, we thought we’d jump right into the ridiculously powerful &lt;em&gt;Core Set 2021&lt;/em&gt; that was just released…&lt;/p&gt; You see, we’ve been having a bit of an argument over the superior household animal and I need your help proving him wrong once and for all. That’s right. Chev and his felines are facing off against Julian’s canines: it’s Cats Versus Dogs. Cats Core set 2021 is the redemption cats need after their failed attempt on the silver screen. Between Feline Sovereign and Pridemalkin we’re seeing some absolute stunners represented which is only making the case for kitten superiority stronger. But first, let me introduce you all to someone. He’s been with my family for about half the time of me or my sister, but has already been elevated to favorite child. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s listed first in my parents’ will. What? You dare accuse me of trying to use cute cat photos to convince you that cats are superior? Why that’s, that’s outrageous! I would never! ..Is it working? Cat Kong There are probably two main ways you can take a cat Commander build: Wide ( Jazal Goldmane , Jedit Ojanen of Efrava , Mirri, Weatherlight Duelist ) or Equipment ( Nazahn, Revered Blacksmith , Balan, Wandering Knight , Kemba, Kha Regent ). We’ll be focusing on the wide archetype. Equipment is cool, but I generally prefer to measure fun in CCPM. Or “Cats cast per minute” and the wide strategy has a much stronger CCPM score. So who do we choose to lead our legion of leopards?! Back in 2017, Wizards designed the Commander set around particular tribes of popular Magic creatures. While some of you might be more familiar with Edgar Markov and The Ur-Dragon , This magnificent creature also made quite the appearance: That’s right, a freaking savage, world-roaring CAT! Where were dogs Julian? Probably out sniffing their butts or something. Arahbo ushered in a new era for cat-kind in our favorite casual format by not only being an absolute stud, but also finding ways to provide value wherever our furry friend ends up thanks to eminence. He is exactly what cats need to conquer the multiverse! Muwahahaha… huh? Who said that? Let’s uhh, let’s take a look at the deck! Feline Ferocity Arahbo, Roar of the World always allows us to buff one cat per turn +3/+3, but if he’s on the board, we also can pay {1}{G}{W} for each attacking cat to double its power and toughness. Okay, that’s pretty beast. I mean common household aggro name Xenagos, God of Revels can only double one creature’s stats a turn and he’s a GOD. Point, Arahbo. To best utilize Arahbo’s bounty of beautiful abilities we want to lean heavily on the aggressive nature of our commander and be dropping cats left and right. I want to overwhelm our enemies with cuddly cuteness and claws of steel. Luckily, most cats tend to agree. There are a bajillion ways to generate cat tokens in this deck, these are just the top few. Even better, a lot of the token generation doesn’t even involve tapping, so we can ball out on the attack and still come back with double the number of war-ready cheetahs. (Well, unless you’re poor Pride Sovereign who finds generating tokens so strenuous they have to take two turns off to recover. Taking a nap, drinking some Eternal’s blood, whatever Amonkhet cats do) This allows us to utilize the benefits of Arahbo the most, by giving us as many targets as possible with doubled stats, if we have the mana to back that up. Once we do, this can easily start snowballing. Of course, you might be a little hesitant to spend your mana doubling the power of a legion of 1/1s. Hey I don’t blame yah. Good thing we got lords for DAYZ. Be they true feline or leonin, cats have been getting buffed since the early 2000s. Dogs…I mean, they got Pack Leader …which is cute and oh so fluffy, but here’s areminder of what the cats are working with? Just get one of these bad boys on the field and we’re already talking about our 1/1 tokens becoming 4/4s with Arahbo’s boost. Not to mention the glorious inclusion of Beastmaster Ascension , Mirari’s Wake , Overwhelming Stampede , and True Conviction to add even more base power. We’re all about redundancy. Just imagine an army of these absolute chonks coming at ya. You’d run. I’d run. And we all know a dog would run. Aide-de-Camp We’ve also got a friend from Ikoria who serves as Arahbo’s right-hand cat in the war against canines, Kaheera, the Orphanguard . Kaheera provides support as another lord for our army, and a giver of vigilance, a fantastic buff allowing us both offense and defense. Taking advantage of the absolutely bonkers way the companion mechanic is integrating with Commander, i.e. allowing us a 101st card, this allows Kaheera to be an essential 9th card in our starting hand meaning instant lord access. Yes, the companion change means I need to drum up 3 mana first to get Kaheera into my hand but she’s still suuuper powerful. And we’re in green so like, nbd. Insult to Injury Sometimes, buff cats just aren’t enough. Even with a powerful second-in-command and Arahbo dropping buffs like a cleric, we might need to call in a helping hand. We need something like… Which also just got reprinted! Just to be safe, we also have Mirror Entity waiting in the wings to provide a party buff, and more individual tactical advantages like Berserk and Hunter’s Prowess if we need to deliver the death strike with a single Serpopard. Psssst You know this last one might not even be fair. I can’t in good conscience give you this strat. Dogs probably haven’t deserved this absolute obliteration… …so I’ll tell you, whatever you do, do not add Nine Lives and Solemnity to your build. And especially no tutors like idyllic Tutor or Enlightened tutor . That would, that would be terrible. Sure, all dogs might go to heaven - but cats can live forever (with the right enchantment). Cats Cats Cats Decklist Dogs The domesticated portion of the canine family tree that we know as dogs have been called many things; fluffers, floofers,woofers, puppies, doggos, good boys and girls, just to name a few. But never have they been called hounds. This was a mistake that Magic had been making since the game’s inception (minus Zodiac Dog, Portal was weird). But the release of Core 2021 and Jumpstart we have been given a blessing in the errata of the hound creature type to dog. And with this change, Wizards has started to give doggos the love that they deserve in the form of true tribal support, something that those wretched cats have been receiving en masse for the past few years . And most of the cat tribal support until just recently derives from lion men being a thing in Magic for forever, which I think is a little unfair. I believe dogs and wolves (both the were and non-were varieties) should be able to run in the same pack, but alas. As a proud dog owner and lover since I was born, it’s only natural that I remind the world who the best pets are with a dog-themed Commander deck! And also I want to put Chev in his place… A Bite to Back Up the Bark Dogs come in all different breeds, and despite there only being a measly 89 dogs printed in the game’s nearly 30 year history, they can be found in all 5 colors! Since dogs have been printed so sparingly, Wizards hasn’t had time to really find the sweet spot on canine design. I’m not gonna sugarcoat it: most of these cards aren’t… competitive. However, there are a few floofers that I want to draw attention to. The best and newest is Pack Leader . The only dog lord, he is absolutely essential for our pack to succeed. Also from Core 21 is Selfless Savior . Many people have said that they would die for their dog, but this little pup is willing to put himself on the line for our cause. Being able to protect our Pack Leader or another crucial canine is a godsend. Hailing from Tarkir and bringing back memories of our foundational Magic days are Ainok Guide and Ainok Survivalist . The former helps fix our five color mana base and the latter, along with newcomer Rambunctious Mutt , is great at picking off an opposing Coat of Arms or Mirari’s Wake (that’s right Chev, I see the shenanigans you’re up to playing real cards). Two more powerful and more ferocious options are Underworld Cerberus and his counterpart Kunoros, Hound of Athreos . When people have signs that read “Beware of Guard Dog,” they’re talking about these guys. No one is getting close to their graveyards when these guys are around. Man’s Best Friend Now, if the puppers were just going at it alone, it would be a rough time. But, luckily, dogs aren’t known as ‘Man’s Best Friend’ for nothing. We’ve got a whole team of breeders, walkers, trainers, etc in tow to support these furballs! First up is Alpine Houndmaster . A new addition, this guy brings along his two best buddies right to our hand for some sick card advantage. Speaking of card advantage, Den Protector , Archaeomancer , and Snapcaster Mage all make sure that we continually have toys for our dogs to play with, while Gerrard, Weatherlight Hero makes sure that we continually have doggos to play with our toys Lastly we have Drannith Magistrate and Containment Priest to make sure that those tricksy cats (or reanimation players) can’t cheat us. Two for One Now, we are bringing a few more creatures who are simultaneously Man and Best Friend: changelings. There’s a running joke that Chameleon Colossus is the best insert tribe here and it’s no different for dogs. Our changelings are generally powerful and also receive all the bonuses for being a dog while also being a human. Irregular Cohort , Taurean Mauler , and Graveshifter are all welcome additions to the pack. Which now leads us to the elephant (dog? changeling?) in the room. “Julian”, I rhetorically say to myself alone in my room in a voice meant to mimic you readers, “This is a Commander deck, who’s our general?” To which I say, “I have some unfortunate news kids.” There is no* dog commander. Kunoros and Isamaru, Hound of Konda are legendary dogs, but they don’t provide the color depth needed to shelter our strays. Rin and Seri, Inseparable while an interesting card in design space is absolute heresy when we’re here to show the cats that dogs are superior. We cannot have a cat in power. And thus we turn to technicalities. Morophon, the Boundless has helmed many an under-supported tribal deck and they’ll do the same for us. Providing us mana cost reductions while also buffing our dogs (or humans, depending on our board at the time we cast him) will secure him a spot as the pack alpha. Throw a Dog a … If there’s one thing that dogs love to do, it’s play! Cats are lame. They just sit around, do their own thing, and only seek human attention when it’s dinner time. Dogs want love, affection, and for their owner to stop playing arena and go outside to throw a bone or ball. (Of course since this is a war against the feline menace, we generally will be playing with sharper and pointier toys, but we do have a few balls to toss.) Mirari and it’s Wake are both important for us. Fixing and accelerating is crucial in a five color deck and being able to copy things like Swords to Plowshares or even an Eladamri’s Call can get us out of hairy situations. Sword of Fire and Ice and Sword of Feast and Famine (among others, we’re playing five swords), aren’t exactly a T-bone for our pups to gnaw on, but they will sure help us hold back the cat crusade. And of course we also have to suit up our doggos with some Lightning Greaves and Swiftfoot Boots so they can chase Arahbo and Brimaz out of town. And of course, at the end of the day, we’ll be flying our Vanquisher’s Banner , or more likely using it to wipe the mud and blood off our dogs’ feet. Can’t have them tracking it through the house. It’s a Dog Eat Dog World It’s ruff out there, especially for dogs in Magic. But these most recent sets are looking like they might teach the old dogs some new tricks. This deck is not exactly powerful, but it’s fun and on theme! We’re running tutors and good removal to shore up our lack of powerhouse dogs. Soon enough though, we’ll have enough tribal support for a real deck that can go toe to toe with the tribal giants like Elves and Merfolk. (Also to provide a contingency we are running the Academy Rector , Kaervek’s Spite , Barren Glory combo which is not one you see, like… ever. Figured we could mix things up, especially if Chev is talking about Solemnity shenanigans, that degenerate.) Doggos Go! Decklist So, there you have it! Two fantastic new tribal decks featuring some of Magic’s goodest boys, and fantastic felines. Which side will you chose? Duel Decks &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tribal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cats Versus Dogs (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/duel%20decks/2020/07/10/dd1_catvdogs.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;only the luckiest of clovers (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/on%20the%20rocks/2020/07/06/otr4_naya_adventures.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/7/c/7c5d0560-f9e6-4c70-8cce-cae61e4e74bc.jpg?1572490518&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Only The Luckiest of Clovers (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;On the Rocks&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome back one and all to the fourth installment of &lt;em&gt;On the Rocks&lt;/em&gt;! Jund Food was so much fun last time and piloting it reminded me of the power, but also the fun play patterns, of &lt;em&gt;Throne of Eldraine&lt;/em&gt; cards (yes yes, I know there are some who would beg to differ).&lt;/p&gt; With that on the mind, I decided to virtually sleeve up an Adventure deck, but not one that’s been in the limelight. This time we’re playing Naya Adventures! I love the Lucky Clover / Edgewall Innkeeper core and I figured we should give some love to the lesser used adventure cards. Check out the gameplay video to see me cast Bonecrusher Giant a lot.

I’m Eric and I’ll be your guide for most of this series. I am being brought on to add a new voice and additional perspectives to &lt;em&gt;Hexdrinkers&lt;/em&gt;. You can read more about me and find other articles by me on my author page here (https://hexdrinkers.com/authors/eric.html)! &lt;em&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/em&gt; is a new series, focusing on unique commanders that have exciting potential in both competitive and casual magic. There are a lot of commanders that fall into this category but we’ll start with one that I have been interested in for a long time: &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/c19/38/atla-palani-nest-tender?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/f/6/f6aa473b-85cd-431d-844b-218368fe955e.jpg?1568003640&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Atla Palani, Nest Tender &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Her ability initially makes you wonder what ‘Eggs ‘are there in Magic and how good are they? Don’t let the eggs fool you though, for the competitive build we’re looking at today the real eggs aren’t eggs at all. Instead they are Changelings! Creature’s with the Changeling ability count as eggs, which is just fine for our purpose. Atla was originally a secondary commander in C19. The base deck was designed to continuously create and copy tokens. Jumping off from that point would typically make you think of creatures that make tokens or a large battlecruiser deck that cheats some mana through sacrificing eggs. We’ll even be going into one of those later in this article. But for now, we’re going to look at Atla as a combo focused commander. I’m not Even Yolking, It Works Atla has a bespoke combo that works with her triggered ability. It requires us to run the following cards: Mirror Entity , a card that does damage when it enters or leaves the battlefield, and a card which can shuffle our graveyard back in when it dies. Additionally, Atla needs to have either a temporary stat bonus for the turn or a +1/+1 counter. The good news is that we only need Atla, Mirror Entity , and the buff in play to actually start the combo. The rest can be in our deck, our graveyard, or even exiled from the game. Let’s step through the combo now to just get a base example of how it works. With both Atla Palani, Nest Tender and Mirror Entity on the field, give Atla at least +1/+1 then activate Mirror Entity ’s ability for zero mana an arbitrarily large number of times. This will set the toughness of all your creatures to zero and makes them all eggs, but Atla will survive due to the buffs we just gave her. Mirror Entity will die and cause the next creature in your deck to flip onto the field. It too will be an egg with zero toughness, so it’ll die and rotate out as well. This repeats until we run out of creatures. We can loop this process by shuffling our graveyard back into the deck with a card like Kozilek, Butcher of Truth . Finally, Goblin Arsonist will eventually kill all our opponents by pinging them each time it leaves the battlefield. Protecting Our Nest Eggs Most competitive EDH metas are rife with stax and other defensive tools to prevent combo wins like ours. So, included in this deck are a variety of creatures who will help remove those obstructions as we cycle through with the Atla combo. Goblin Sharpshooter can kill any creature without Hexproof and Manglehorn can do the same for artifacts. We’re even running Caustic Caterpillar to get around things that shut off enter the battlefield effects. Riftsweeper can recover any of our helpful creatures that have been exiled, offering us some protection against even instant speed graveyard hate. So if you’re feeling bold you can try to combo off in the face of almost any defensive setup and just see if the heart of the cards is on your side. These creatures will do a lot of work toward protecting us after we’ve entered the loop, but we’ll need some protection beforehand as well. Naya doesn’t have a very wide selection of cards that fall into that category. However, we can still find some powerful cards among them, see Pyroblast and Red Elemental Blast . Additionally, bask in the groans of the table every time you get to cast Veil of Summer and Autumn’s Veil . Naya Can’t Combo… Unless? Competitive decks can struggle if they only have one route to victory. So, in order to avoid those issues we’re going to run a suite of other typical combos that fall into our colors. The first ones that come to mind for most are the variations involving Kiki Jiki, Mirror Breaker . We’re going to be running multiple cards that allow for different infinites with Kiki as well as Splinter Twin to add consistency. Offense isn’t going to be enough to get us across the line though. On the scale of cEDH decks, we don’t expect to keep up with Tier 0 decks, but we do need to be able to stop some decks faster than ours. In order to do this we’ll be running a light stax package to compete with those strategies. But not to worry, we won’t hurt our own game plan too much. Root Maze and Kataki, War’s Wage have always stood out to me as solid cards for the format given the omnipresence of artifacts. Both Thalia, Heretic Cathar and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben will also give us a chance to pump the brakes on other common strategies. A few of our other powerhouse defensive cards are shown below. Easter Egg Hunt Now, for the final question: How are we going to find and play all these cards we just talked about? To play our main combo in one turn is a minimum of eight mana, including four colored mana (WWRG). In order to find all our pieces and have the mana to play them, ramp and tutors are going to be key. We run an interesting mix of ramp packages to make sure that our hate cards (and those of our opponents) don’t end up hitting us too hard. Mana dorks, such as Birds of Paradise , Bloom Tender , and Arbor Elf are always good to have around, so we’ll toss a few of those in. Artifact ramp is a staple in cEDH if only due to its raw power. So including cards like Mana Vault and Sol Ring can help us accelerate to key turns when it really matters. Finally, by rounding out with a few choice enchantments, shown below, we end up with a very strong looking ramp package. Of course, draw engines such as Sylvan Library will always have their place, but we want to go even faster. So instead we’re looking for direct tutors such as Altar of Bone and Sylvan Tutor . Some of our alternate win conditions require us to find enchantments so we’ll be running Enlightened Tutor and Academy Rector as well. Most of our wins require specific creatures though, which green does a fantastic job of tutoring for with cards like Chord of Calling and Finale of Devastation . We run a lot of tutors so I won’t go into all of them, but a few more of our choice selection are shown below: Well, that is all on our competitive deck. With this guide on the build you can feel free to make your own meta dependent switches. In the sideboard of the deck I call out a few helpful cards that can be subbed in depending on budget and meta. Even if your first few matches end up being a bit scrambled or hard boiled, I’m sure you’ll be winning matches over easy in no time! (I’m not even close to sorry about the egg puns). Full Decklist All Our Eggs In One Basket Let’s take a step back now that we’ve finished one of our decks. We originally said this commander would be great for a less competitive build focused on eggs, tokens, and the sweet sweet taste of battlecruiser magic. Well, I’m excited to let you know that’s exactly what we’re talking about next. This build is going to run you under $200 and should fit in a more casual and/or combat focused meta. Atla Palani, Nest Tender will still be front and center, but we still have one lurking question about this deck… How many eggs are we allowed to run? Dragon Egg was printed not too long ago, so surely there should be plenty in magic’s long history, right? And that’s it! All the Naya eggs. Wait, that’s it? Frantically checking notes. That can’t be it, right? How are we going to make this deck work with four eggs? Well, we’re going to have to rely on Atla’s slightly underwhelming activated ability for the most part. But, we still have some good news coming! Nesting Dragon is able to crank out at least an egg a turn while we’re hitting our land drops. Additionally, there are a few changelings that we can run to fill in our empty nest. (PSA, do not try to activate Mirror Entity’s ability for 0 in this deck. You will not enjoy the results.) What if we clone our eggs?. Atla and Nesting Dragon both make egg tokens, so populating and doubling tokens can be very powerful for us… Of course a lot of token doublers would bust our budget pretty hard, but Second Harvest is a great fit and Growing Ranks is a good example of a repeated populate effect. We’re also going to be on the lookout for cards that give us other benefits in addition to copying our eggs, such as the following cards: Loot Boxes, In My Card Game? Well, now it’s time to hatch those eggs and find out just what is inside! In order to cycle through these eggs fast enough to see our powerful cards, we’re going to need some sacrifice outlets or ways to crack these eggs. In Naya we don’t have a ton of options, but they definitely exist. For example, Greater Gargadon and Dragon Broodmother allow us to add more top end to our deck and start off our sacrifice package right. Martyr’s Cause offers us a good defensive option and can set up a strong counter punch. Switching out one of our eggs for a beefy blocker can seriously disrupt our opponent’s plans. I also want to offer a specific call out for Slaughter the Strong which allows us to sacrifice all our eggs, keep Atla on the field, and clear the way for all the creatures about to hatch. Artifacts are going to let us fill out the rest of this package. We’re going to be running a pretty tight selection of creatures so that every time we crack an egg we either get another egg or a powerful creature. Enter the battlefield triggers will really help exaggerate the effects we get from cheating mana. Combustible Gearhulk and Ravager Wurm are both cards that immediately present a strong board presence and give us an upside when they come into play. Angel of Serenity and Terastodon also fall into this category as well. They help us keep the board clear as we’re hatching these massive creatures. Naya is also a home to creatures that are incredibly powerful when they get to sit on the field. Vigor is a pet card of mine that I think will do great work for us. It manages to simultaneously discourage people from attacking us or blocking our creatures. Aurelia, the Warleader is arguably one of the most powerful cards we get to include. Multiple combat steps can allow for massive and unexpected swing turns. Green Eggs and Ramp I think there’s some bad news coming though… We may not always get to turn a bunch of eggs into massive creatures at little to no cost. We may at some point need to start paying for these monsters, so mana ramp is going to be a prominent feature of our deck. Unfortunately we don’t get to use mana dorks because seeing one come out of an egg may actually break my heart. Let’s start with the land ramp. Explosive Vegetation and Rampant Growth are obvious classics for a ramp package. But, I’m here to offer the deep cuts, the B sides, of ramp. So let’s talk about Spoils of Victory and Collective Voyage . These cards are going to help us fetch stronger lands and more lands respectively. On the topic of getting more than one land, Khalni Heart Expedition and Tempt with Discovery can be very powerful as well (Never get tempted by someone else by the way). Lands aren’t the only way to ramp though, artifact ramp is in some ways even more powerful, but with its own weaknesses. The signets are a great way to start off at this power level, so let’s toss in the full set. Sol Ring is one of the best cards in this category and should be pretty easy to get your hands on. Commander’s Sphere and Fellwar Stone are also going to do great things for us in terms of mana fixing. Well, that concludes my analysis on this version of the deck. I tried to keep this to a budget that made sense to me, but I remember hating spending money on lands when I could get some game winning eight-drops for the same price. I’ve offered some higher end suggestions in the maybe board of the deck list. Feel free to make any substitutions you’d like though! This is a deck that can be driven in pretty much any direction. Tribal and Token themes could be more pronounced if that appealed to you. If you have any commanders you’d like to see me do an analysis of like this or any thoughts on the series feel free to let us know on Twitter or in the comments below!

They claim no one else even wanted to interview them…preposterous. Here is our unedited question section from that interview. Enjoy:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Q: Wow, THE Julian Leal and Chev Eldrid? It’s so good to finally meet you! I’ve been following you guys ever since that welcome article and continue to come back two times a week! JL: …Chev, what’s going on? Aren’t you the one writing this? CE: What? No, this is a very unbiased reporter who is also a big fan of ours. I’m just happy we could make the time for them. Please, continue. Q: Thank you Chev. Now we’ve known Hexdrinkers as a brand first, and its people second. Obviously Julian is the one responsible for classics like the “On The Rocks” series and Chev has really taken to the MTGA Brawl format, but aside from the writing we don’t know much about you both. JL: Yes we’re very private people. That’s why we like to keep our Twitter account as a single follower and keep our site relatively unlisted on Google. It’s what has helped us really cultivate our “elusive” persona. Q: That can’t possibly be on purpose. CE: …psh yeah it totally is, shut up. Q: Anyway, I’ve gathered a set of questions that I hope will shed some more light on who you two are, your favorite experiences with magic, and what makes you two unique in the world of mtg content producers. So with that I’d love to get started? JL: Perfect! Question 1: You both joined the game in the Khans block, right? What would you say has been your favorite standard set since joining in 2015? JL: It has to be what we started with: Dragons of Tarkir. So many interesting and flashy cards, especially the Dragon Lords. That’s how our LGS tempted us into trying Magic out. I’ve always loved 3-color decks since then and the abundance of legendaries helped us transition nicely into Commander. That was like the wild west back then, but it was super fun, figuring out how to actually play and trying out innocent fun brews before we knew anything about ‘tiers’ and ‘metas’. It’s that sort of style that we want to emulate and recreate. CE: I think I’d have to go with Dominaria. For me, even though the full history of Dominaria didn’t resonate with me as well as more enfranchised players, I still recognized a lot of the characters like Jhoira Weatherlight Captain and Karn, Scion of Urza . Dominaria was also the height of my paper involvement in the game thanks to a really welcoming FNM community when I was studying in New Zealand and the incredible amount of Brawl I played with Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive . 10/10 Would do it again. Question 2: Starting from one base color, what color combinations do you most resonate with up through the shards/wedges? JL: Blue for me. Yup, I’m that guy in our playgroup, despite not playing that many counterspells. I’ve always been a Johnny, and being able to play at instant speed, ready to react to any situation as well as creatively set up awesome plays and win-cons is exactly where I want to be. My first decks were prowess decks with big flyers and then transitioned into Simic value in Commander. Secondarily, it’s a toss-up between black and white, but I have to go with white, making me Azorius. White has everything I want in a support color as a control player. Powerful removal, excellent sideboard cards, and a few big flashy fliers to close out the game (I had a notorious angel deck in the early days of our playgroup). CE: Ask him why it was notorious, the answer may surprise you. JL: …Lastly, my shard identity would be Esper. My longest standing commander deck is Dakkon Blackblade control and my first “favorite” deck was Esper Dragons from Standard during Khans block and Origins. The combination of being able to deal with any permanent that hits the battlefield and the card advantage of blue and black is right where I want to be. Plus it includes some of my all time favorite cards Vindicate , Utter End (another love from Khans Block), and Anguished Unmaking . That being said, I’ve found homes in all colors and am actively working to move outside my comfort zone in all formats….. But if I had my way, I’d play Esper Control whenever I could. CE: While I initially leaned green, thanks to an absolutely bonkers Elf duel deck…I’ve definitely shifted more towards black in recent years as a primary color. I really like the idea of success at any cost. Sacrificing your own creatures or using your own life as a resource to get ahead. That philosophy actually inspired the Selenia, Dark Angel Commander deck I’ve had for years and still love piloting: take yourself down to near zero life just to swap with someone else. It’s all about using your own stability to take others down with you. I pick green back up in the two color identity, always having been a big fan of the Golgari utilizing that black theme and adding the warped growth of green when paired with black. This is especially true when looking at my Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons commander deck. Inflicting those -1/-1s upon myself and my armies to slowly wither you down with deathtouch snakes. It’s a riot! Lastly, I would say that Abzan is my three-color. I have the least amount of attachment to this identity but it was my first theme deck purchase with Ivorytusk Fortress back in Khans, and I continue to find myself scheming with Abzan commanders…even if none ever get assembled. Question 3: Is there any particular card in the game that you have particularly strong memories of? Good or bad. JL: Mirrorwing Dragon from Eldritch Moon. That card is sweeeeeet. It was the centerpiece of the first Standard deck that I brewed and fully built to play at FNM. The deck consisted of a bunch of good rate creatures and efficient pump spells so you could target the dragon and buff your whole team like crazy and swing out. The deck did reasonably well, was a lot of fun to play, and was a big personal victory for my deck-building infancy. CE: Oh, easily Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger . One of the first mythic rares I pulled and just the raw power emanating from that card…woof. It quickly became the centerpiece of an EDH deck that lives on today under Kozilek, the Great Distortion but has also fallen under Kruphix, God of Horizons and Animar, Soul of Elements . Eldrazi Tribal deck has always been one of my favorites, and I’m really hoping for some new tech in the fall Zendikar set. But yeah, Ulamog started it all. Question 4: If you had to forge a life somewhere in the multiverse, what plane would you most want to find yourself on? JL: Shandalar. It’s a “rogue plane,” it drifts through the Multiverse doing it’s own thing and not much is known about that. I like that sort of vibe and I like the peaceful and serene lifestyle of being off the beaten path, communing with nature, etc. Also, it’s super mana rich and all the artwork from there looks gorgeous, so it’d be great for someone who likes to be outside like myself. CE: I think…Kaladesh. Post Aether Revolt. Just an absolutely beautiful aesthetic that was brought to life in one of Magic storytellings more successful runs. As a software developer, I love the idea of a plane with technology built into its very core and as a set it introduced so many cool new cards and ideas (including a bunch of bannings but hey, Live Fast Die Young ). Question 5: What excites you most currently about Magic as a whole? JL: The breadth of ways to play. In the beginning we just lumped whatever cards we had together and fought it out in our basements. Then we jumped into Commander, later on started drafting, and now I’m playing competitively in Standard on Arena. We dabbled in other formats, but there’s still so many ways to play Magic that I want to experience and become knowledgeable about. CE: Currently? I’d say the depth. As we’re trying to start this website with our own ideas and views - we’re constantly discovering new strategies or archetypes that we can really sink our teeth into without stepping on too many toes. There’s always more to discover and explore. Question 6: So, we all know the Player Archetypes of Magic, but which do you think most resonate with you? JL: I said this earlier, but definitely Johnny. CE: Johnny, with a side of Vorthos. Julian will be the first to tell you of my propensity to play “bad cards” because I feel they either fall on-theme or I think they have more potential than they really do. Just ask him about Eternal Scourge and Ice Cauldron in my Eldrazi deck… JL: … I don’t wanna talk about those cards. Q: Wow! Well, I think that’s all we have time for today. Thank you so much for your time! I have to be off but I hope to see you both again soon! JL: WAIT! YOU CAN’T LEAVE ME ALONE WITH HIM HE- Meta &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A Casual Sitdown with the Founders&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/meta/2020/06/29/author_faq.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;you feelin’ hungry, punk?

I mean come on!!! Almost makes a man want to buy a box. Can’t be as bad as the Origins boxes Julian and I opened a little over 5 years ago…can it?&lt;/p&gt; Over these next couple weeks before release, we at Hexdrinkers thought we’d focus on some of the new cards joining us this summer. One of which has also inspired the first mono-red commander deck I’ve ever put together. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FORRRRR SUBIRA, TULZIDI CARAVANNER! She’s got haste, she’s got the ability to make our mini-minions unblockable, AND has a pretty handy take on red card draw. Get it? Handy? Ahhh I wonder if Julian will let that through editing EDITOR’S NOTE: (I did, I am sorry - Julian). Let’s take Subira’s textbox line-by-line while we start to form some ideas on how to build a deck that most accurately shows off this new legend’s power. Break it Down Haste Okay maybe we don’t need to spend so much time on this one BUT it does help highlight the aggressive nature of this no-nonsense caravan leader. You know we’ll be swinging on turn 3 at whoever still doesn’t have a creature out. There’s always one. {1}: Another target creature with power 2 or less can’t be blocked this turn. This is probably going to be the most important line on the entire card. Subira wants as many small creatures attacking as possible, but we’ll need the mana to pay for it. This seems like a less conditional, but more restrictive version of another Jamuraa legend we saw in C16, Sidar Kondo of Jamuraa . While that version doesn’t require an activation cost, I don’t think Sidar Kondo is nearly as powerful as Subira, and we’ll get to why in a minute. I also want to point out that Subira’s ability says another target creature can’t be blocked. So no shenanigans with a self-target and pumping for commander damage. {1}{R}, {T}, Discard Your Hand: Until end of turn, whenever a creature you control with power 2 or less deals combat damage to a player, draw a card. Ooooo boy. Okay. This whole “whenever a creature deals combat damage, draw a card” is not an ability we generally see in red. Like, at all. From a couple informed Scryfall searches I couldn’t find a single example of this ability being used outside of blue and green with cards like Bident of Thassa and Keeper of Fables . This is a big deal. Yes, the creatures have to have power two or less - but considering that’s the same condition for unblockability it reinforces the cornerstones of our deck. No concerns here. The only downside of course is discarding your whole hand…but I don’t think it’ll be as big a deal as we might think. We can also capitalize on it with cards like Glint-Horn Buccaneer and Brallin, Skyshark Rider . Bottomline, when combined with the above ability to make all our creatures unblockable, we’ll be drawing an obscene amount of cards in a color that generally struggles to do so. Take that Sidar Kondo. So we’ve got a commander that can push through damage AND draw us cards at a consistent rate, we just need to do it on her terms. Meaning we need an army of creatures that are power two or less. In Red. I wonder where we’re going to find them… Down, down to Goblin Town That’s right, it’s a caravan of goblins and Subira is leading them on a quest to pillage and loot until your opponents are crying for mercy. Goblins are by nature very low to the ground and annoying little punks which is exactly what we’re looking for. Whether it be through token generation, goblin tutors (which there are a surprising amount of), or just a lot of creatures, we’ll be filling the board quickly and effectively. Bring on the Goblins Focusing first on the incredible rate at which Goblins produce more goblins, it’s no surprise that most other goblin commanders are potent token generators. Krenko has a long history of bringing an overwhelming force of rage every turn, and while Pashalik is a newer addition to the scene - he’s just as ready to keep cranking out 1/1s. We’ve also got cards like Beetleback Chief and Empty the Warrens when Krenko or Pashalik can’t pull all the weight on their own. Our other main method of getting goblins into play is by tutoring and cheating them onto the battlefield. I’ll be honest, I did not expect this subtheme to be available, color me pleasantly surprised. Gosh darn it, these little goblin buggers are starting to earn my respect! Between Goblin Matron , Warren Instigator , and Goblin Lackey no matter what goblin we need - whether it be token generators or a tribal payoff - they’ll all be close at hand. Ankle Shanking So now we’ve got a board full of goblins, what do we do with them? Krenko and Pashalik brought all their friends to the party, but it’s Subira’s job to keep them entertained. Between Subira’s first ability, Purphoros, God of the Forge , Cavalcade of Calamity , and Boggart Shenanigans it doesn’t matter what our goblins are doing - our opponents will be feeling the pain. Goblin enters the battlefield, Purphoros and Impact tremors lay on the heat. Goblin attacks, get ready for Cavalcade of Calamity, and Raid Bombardment . Goblin dies, Boggart Shenanigans makes sure we have the last laugh. And When all that’s not enough, Gratuitous Violence and Fiery Emancipation raise the red pain train up to 11, turning even the minor-est of pings into a full blown smack. We’ve also got the Standard champ Torbran, Thane of Red Fell joining in on the fun! Now, I’m not a big math guy but if I do some calculations, carry the two, multiply by three… I think we’re looking at a metric %$@#-ton of damage per goblin. Draw, Go Once in a while we’ll feel like our hand is somewhat in need of a refresher, and Subira will need to make use of that secondary ability, giving us a whole lotta extra ammunition from our army of critters. We will need to spend two mana on the draw ability, so make sure you factor that into your unblockable mana-dump calculations. That is of course unless you’ve got a Battle Hymn or Brightstone Ritual in hand…then all bets are off. We’re also running Glint-Horn Buccaneer to take full advantage of the discard effect present on both Subira and cards like Faithless Looting . Even our “drawing” will hurt our opponents! Mwuahahaha! The Team Players Like any incredibly sinister plan to poke our opponents to death, this wouldn’t be possible without the hard work of plenty of other cards keeping our goblins happy, healthy, and unblocked. Give it up for the best of the rest! Helping Subira make the most of those many mini attacks we’ve got Kamigawa’s own Akki Underminer . A 1/1 goblin who makes our opponent sacrifice a permanent anytime it deals combat damage! Who designed this guy?! Don’t care, it’s a beast and I love it. Throne of the God-Pharaoh deals one extra helping of butt-whooping with each turn our goblin army attacks, and Shared Animosity triggers after we’d make creatures unblockable so we get an actual massive amount of damage through with just a few goblins! We’ve also got Meekstone , Red Elemental Blast , Deflecting Swat , and more keeping our board and commander safe from any sort of interaction from our pesky opponents. Lastly, the cleanup step. If our endless damage locomotive of goblins isn’t enough for an unparalleled victory we’ve got a couple extra tricks up our sleeve. Like any good red deck, we’ve got Insurrection as a solid Plan B and Price of Progress in the Plan C position to hopefully take everyone down at least ten life for daring to play multicolor decks. I mean, the nerve! And if all that doesn’t work. Well. Clearly a couple of your goblins must have stepped on their own mines like their buddy Goblin Kaboomist . Can’t be helped when dealing with the lil’ numskulls… I think that about wraps up how much I’m willing to say before giving you all the decklist but rest assured there are plenty of surprises left in store should you take this puppy for a drive! Enjoy everything Subira has to offer with her Goblin Caravan and stick around for more sick M21 builds!!

Whether you’re John Wick, the oblivious half of a rom-com couple, or perhaps the greatest comeback champ of all time: Taylor Swift.&lt;/p&gt; Love Story In our last Brawl Homebrew (found here), we explored the potential of an absolute blast from the past, Hanna, Ships Navigator , the Brawl Guildhall legend of the month. For me, it was love at first sight. Fresh off building an incredible Selesnya Auras deck championed by Siona, Captain of the Pyleas , I felt the switch to Azorius for similar Enchanted shenanigans would be relatively simple. Recursion of our Elspeth Conquers Death and Kiora Bests the Sea God seemed too good to pass up! But as we soon discovered, Magic has come a long way since Invasion and what was once an absolutely incredible ability comes in just too little too late 9 times out of 10. Legends like Yarok, the Desecrated or Snapdax, Apex of the Hunt continued to have the drop on our build making Hanna feel a bit like a liability. While we didn’t lose those games, they were always incredibly close. In fact our only loss was to… Another enchantment and artifact commander, except this one has an extra slew of keywords and doesn’t need to be tapped. It was a bloodbath. Alela and her flock (is a grouping of faeries called a flock? A mischief?) dive-bombed poor Hanna until there was nothing left. Absolute tragedy. But I know this is not the end Taylor Swift would approve of. No, if she were here she’d say to be Fearless, because in the wise words of the rocker herself, “Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want all over again… even though every time you’ve tried before, you’ve lost.” I can’t let T Swift down. Maybe Hanna just isn’t the right call for enchantments/artifacts in Brawl right now. Perhaps we’ll get more powerful artifact support down the line that will help her become an absolute powerhouse but for now, I need to look elsewhere if I want to succeed with an artifact and enchantment focused build. Maybe to Hanna’s greatest nemesis in the Brawl Guildhall. Look What You Made Me Do That’s right. It’s time to put on our war paint, get our act together, and bring the fight back to Alela. You know what that means: We’re going to build our own version of the legendary pushed-for-brawl faerie, but better, and it’s going to be absolutely awesome! The disappointing days of dropping enchantments and having to wait for them to leave the battlefield to get value from our commander are gone. As soon as Alela hits the field we’ll be filling it with a Mischief (I’ve decided that’s cooler sounding than a flock) of Faeries that don’t know the word “mercy”. Probably the biggest change to our deck is going to be a flyer subtheme. While Alela creates 1/1 flyers with every enchantment and artifact cast, she also gives all flyers +1/+0 because Alela takes no prisoners…and needed to sell pre-constructed Brawl decks. Divine Visitation is an absolute must for any token theme, trading all our meager 1/1s in for 4/4 Angels, ready to rain down holy hellfire on all those doubters. “In a relationship each person should support the other; they should lift each other up.” Alela provides Divine Visitation with an endless supply of tokens and Visitation makes them the angels they are. It’s a match made in heaven. Winged Words provides draw at an amazing rate with any flyers on the field, and Luminous Broodmoth makes sure any of our wingless support gets their chance in the sky. We’ll also be taking advantage of Archon of Sun’s Grace for even more flying tokens and enchantment synergy, as well as Ethereal Absolution to…okay I’m assuming you’re getting the idea by now. We’re going to have sooo many flyers, it’ll be great. Enchanted Since this deck was initially a derivation of our Hanna deck, there might be some redundancy in this cardpool but we’ll pick out some specific all-stars for the highlights. Most of our enchantments are still sitting squarely in Azorius, with Mire’s Grasp as our only mono-black one, but that’s to be expected. Elspeth Conquering death is quite a saga, and with that first turn being able to permanently exile someone’s commander or any real threat is truly Better Than Revenge. Smothering Tithe is a card I only recently invested a wildcard in and man, oh man was I missing out. Generating disposable mana is incredibly potent, especially against draw decks AND provides the perfect chump fodder against a Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God . All That Glitters should win some kind of record for being in all of our enchantment decks to date, but it’s just so good the decision is warranted. Even at its worst, it’ll give a creature +1/+1 and generate a flying 2/1 so I really can’t ever be complaining. Bad Blood But Chev, if we’re putting our faith in Alela what happens when we take the black? Well, a lot actually. Turns out adding black to our available cardpool is a great way to throw in powerful removal. Who knew?! That’s right, this time we’re not messing around. Yes, we’re still running Heliod’s Punishment and Banishing Light as a first line of defense (and synergy), but fool me twice? Baby, now we got Bad Blood and what we’re going to do will be pretty heartless. …Ready for It? Here’s the decklist, and don’t worry I’m not telling Hanna that We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together. I think she still has an incredible amount of utility because, I mean who can pass up the opportunity to drop Kiora bests the Sea God twice in a single game? Not me, that’s for sure. Alela Swift Commander 1x Alela, Artful Provocateur Creatures 1x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 1x Aphemia, the Cacophony 1x Archon of Sun&#39;s Grace 1x Daxos, Blessed by the Sun 1x Hanna, Ship&#39;s Navigator 1x Healer&#39;s Hawk 1x Luminous Broodmoth 1x Meteor Golem 1x Murderous Rider 1x Stonecoil Serpent 1x Tithe Taker 1x Transcendent Envoy Lands 1x Castle Vantress 1x Command Tower 1x Godless Shrine 1x Fabled Passage 1x Hallowed Fountain 2x Island 10x Plains 4x Swamp 1x Temple of Deceit 1x Temple of Enlightenment 1x Watery Grave Enchantments 1x All That Glitters 1x Angelic Gift 1x Banishing Light 1x Divine Visitation 1x Elspeth Conquers Death 1x Ethereal Absolution 1x Heliod&#39;s Punishment 1x Kiora Bests the Sea God 1x Mire&#39;s Grasp 1x Prison Realm 1x Smothering Tithe 1x Staggering Insight 1x The Birth of Meletis Instants 1x Didn&#39;t Say Please 1x Heartless Act 1x Neutralize 1x Unbreakable Formation Artifacts 1x Arcane Signet 1x Heraldic Banner 1x Midnight Clock 1x Traveler&#39;s Amulet Sorceries 1x Swallow Whole 1x Winged Words I Did Something Bad This deck is a powerhouse. While including all the control power Hanna’s Azorius shell was able to provide, stopping dangerous commander’s in their tracks with Prison Realm or Didn’t Say Please , and keeping such enchantment must-haves like Archon of Sun’s Grace , we’re able to create a solid board state before Alela even hits the board. Once she hits the board, the pace goes up to 11 as we start generating fliers at insane rates and just keep the fight in the air to close out the game. In a five-game run we went 4-1, but this loss was incredibly close and was mainly due to drawing nothing but lands for six straight turns. Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God was able to produce just enough flyers to keep us from lethal until finally dropping a Liliana, Dreadhorde General and making us sac our board. A beautiful fight. One ridiculous highlight I wish I caught on stream was the interaction between Kiora Bests the Sea God and Divine Visitation . It’s all fun and games until the 8/8 hexproof kraken you were counting on becomes a 4/4. Doh. All-in-all, this was the comeback of the month, showing the likes of Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy and Yarok, the Desecrated that there are commanders out there who can really utilize the enchantment theme with power and grace. Call It What You Want, but this truly has been The Best Day. Oh, and if you absolutely fall hard and fast for this deck? Don’t blame me. Alela is here to Stay Stay Stay. Enter The Guildhall &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Call it What You Want (Brawl)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/06/12/brawldt_3.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;outlaws&#39; merriment (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/rev%20your%20engines/2020/06/11/rye_3.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/5/d/5d7585ab-a364-471c-8ef1-318e459b4020.jpg?1572490798&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Outlaws&#39; Merriment (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I sit down in a local park to write my article for this week, the sun is shining bright, there’s a cool breeze complimenting the heat of a new summer, and everyone is outside enjoying our Phase 1 freedom. Life is good and it’s about time we celebrated! The Hexdrinkers are throwing the biggest party in Standard, and you’re all invited! So &lt;em&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/em&gt;, start your grills, and fill up your tankards: it’s time for the &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/eld/198/outlaws-merriment?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/5/d/5d7585ab-a364-471c-8ef1-318e459b4020.jpg?1572490798&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Outlaws’ Merriment &lt;/a&gt;! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Since we’re throwing the greatest rager of all time, we need a crowd to match. Outlaws’ Merriment gives us a new party-goer every turn. Some are a bit rowdy, some are those lovable, friendly drunks, and some are ready to start a fight the minute they show up. They all have one thing in common though: they’re ready to party. The excellent folk metal band Windrose once said, “Nobody is safe in a tavern full of drunken dwarves, no respect for humans, dragons, trolls, or pointy ears…” and that’s exactly what we’re aiming for during our Merriment! All these rough and tumble folk converging ensures scuffles, brawls, and general disorder, making this perfect for an aristocrats shell. A Real Motley Crew We’ll be relying on our outlaws to take one for the team, but they won’t be coming to the party alone. Corpse Knight will make sure that everyone who walks into our party does so with a bang (or more accurately, a ‘ping’). Corpsey’s partner in crime, Cruel Celebrant is also here to get us value on the way out when our outlaws fall in combat or are sacrificed, for the greater good, of course. Celebrant’s big sister, Judith, the Scourge Diva takes the brawl to the next level, making our bandits punch harder and sting even more when they get knocked out. With our constant generation of brawlers, we can attack and block as we please, all while dealing massive damage to our opponent. So far we’ve got humans, zombie, and vampires all joining our party. Let’s add goblins, giants, and more zombies to amp it up to 11! Our outlaws like to go fast and so does Dreadhorde Butcher . The more he gets in clean punches, the more powerful he becomes and he gives a hefty parting gift when he finally falls. Imagine a Butcher going down when we have Judith and Cruel Celebrant on the field, that’s three triggers straight to our opponent’s face! Legion Warboss always rolls up to a party with his whole posse. His token generation will supplement out Outlaws’ Merriment for ETB and death triggers and he also can get into the fray helping to Mentor the rookies who haven’t seen a tavern brawl before. Pulling up the rear is Bonecrusher Giant . He may not have much going on upstairs, but he sure can scrap. If you even so much as look at him the wrong way, he’ll stomp you. Last, but not least is the angriest, scrappiest, and most drunken dwarf in the whole of the tavern: Torbran, Thane of Red Fell . Everyone is going to be hitting A LOT harder when this guy enters the brawl. Perfect for knocking out our opponent. Top Me Off, Barkeep With all these brawlers about, people are bound to be falling left and right. We already have cards like Cruel Celebrant and Judith that benefit from this, so why not help facilitate a little more carnage. Bastion of Remembrance does everything we want for this deck. Making an additional token to get into the mix while draining our opponent for everyone for fall on our side is perfect. Weaponize the Monsters helps us take a proactive role. We can sacrifice our outlaws after blocking for extra value, pick off opposing fighters or planeswalkers, and even go straight to our opponent’s face. To help us get even more value out of our motley crew, Luminous Broodmoth lets them get back up for a second round and go over opposing brawlers.

We want our creatures to die and we want to get value off of it. Throw as many punches as possible and ping your opponents. The revel is swinging in full force and not worrying about any consequences. Life really is good y’all! Summer is just beginning and there are many more festivities to be had. And you can bet that Hexdrinkers is going to be hosting. Every. Single. Week. Stay brewing!

Back in the first few years of Magic’s lifespan, there were only a few releases a year. Wizards, as well as the player base were still falling into their stride. Now, any given year, there are three story sets, a core set, a commander product (or several), a masters set, and some other specialty product or innovation set, totaling thousands of new cards. If you’re looking to stand out and carve a niche, especially in older formats, you have to overcome a backlog of over 20,000 cards from a long and storied history of the game.&lt;/p&gt; Wizards has only gotten better at making more powerful and interesting cards, so on average, a card released now will fall by the wayside quickly. It can be even more rough if you’re a rare or mythic rare. With the rarity premium comes pressure to push boundaries either on rate or in design space. And oftentimes these don’t capture the hearts and minds of the players, or they were simply printed at the wrong time, crowded out by cards printed shortly before or after hand. Not Even a Bigger Boat Will Help Today, we’re talking about one such mythic rare: Impervious Greatwurm , the buy-a-box promo for Guilds of Ravnica. Nearly two years later, this absolute unit of an oversized frog snack has seen zero play. Let’s look a bit further, surely there’s some drastic downside that is keeping this Greatwurm from greatness. Based on the vanilla test alone, we’re already winning big. Looking back on those 20,000+ cards and 27 years of Magic, Impervious Greatwurm has the highest power and toughness of any creature, just beating out RtR’s Worldspine Wurm , and absolutely demolishing the original Ravnica’s Autochthon Wurm (what is it with the Selesnya Conclave and stupidly big wurms?). This thing is even bigger than Emrakul, the Aeons Torn , the original gold standard for “holy crap that thing is massive”. Stats aside, let’s read on. Impervious Greatwurm also has Convoke, a flagship mechanic of the Conclave that’s made appearances in many Ravnican sets, as well as some supplemental sets. Makes sense thematically, and at a CMC of 10, it’s nice that there’s a way to cheat a bit on the cost. But when it’s already so big, that reduction still seems unfair, especially if I’m using my mindset from when I first started playing and Siege Rhino was a god card. But that’s not all, there’s one more line of text on the Greatwurm. Hmm let me see here, “Indestructi-..”, HOLD ON WAIT, WHAT? You mean, not only is it the beefiest of boys, but I can cheat on its mana cost and it’s nearly impossible to get rid of? Someone tell me why, in the name of whatever god(s) you pray to, be it those of Theros, those of Amonkhet, or the Dragon God Nicol Bolas himself, this majestic beast has suffered such injustice?!?! With rotation coming in only a few months, we will make Impervious Greatwurm great again (okay, technically not ‘again’, but ‘for the first time’). I Get By With a Little Help From My Friends Luckily, when it comes to haymakers like the Greatwurm, we have built-in directions, as well as precedence, on how to call it into the fray. For the Selesnyans, strength comes in numbers and you’ll need a lot of poor suckers to wrangle the Greatwurm in. Convoking has been a solid strategy in the past for things such as Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis , Chord of Calling , and March of the Multitudes . That’s a good enough pedigree for us to try it. Standard is flush with token makers to help convoke. My personal favorites would be Raise the Alarm and Omen of the Sun for their rate and instant-speed versatility. Others like Rally for the Throne and March of the Multitudes, fueled by convoke and helping to fuel further convokes, could round out a token package. If you wanted to dip into red, Forbidden Friendship is the best upfront rate you’ll get, and Legion Warboss and Krenko, Tinstreet Kingpin provide recurring token generation. Whichever way you lean, don’t forget to sneak in a couple Emmara, Soul of the Accord ’s and Divine Visitation ’s for maximum value. Wurm Harvest So, convoking allows us to get a reduction on mana cost, but we’re still casting our Greatwurm. That’s way too slow and honest for me, so let’s just cheat him into play! Starting with the strategy’s namesake card, people have been Reanimating the most powerful of creatures since the early days of Magic. Reanimation isn’t as easy to come by as token generation, but there are enough powerful effects to fill out a necromantic package for our guest of honor. Pretty much all necromantic interaction stems from black’s portion of the color pie (with some splashes here or there) and it’s usually going to run you a cool five mana. My choice for best option however, is Back For More . Instant speed is an absolute killer as we can ambush and block, we’ll have pseudo haste, and the fight clause on top means we’re getting a three-for-one nearly every time. Next down the list would be Bond of Revival for the haste. The one thing better than suddenly returning the biggest thing imaginable to play, is your opponent having essentially zero time to deal with it. Blood for Bones is a whole turn or two earlier than other options, but it requires a tribute, as well as not granting extra triggers or keywords. Though, if we’re combining a token/convoke idea with reanimation, this would be a no-brainer. Unbreakable Bond is serviceable as that’s a lot of life we’ll be gaining. Once you’ve hit Cauldron’s Gift you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel, and, though interesting, the density of quality auras needed to make Rise to Glory a consistent two-for-one would stretch our deck thin. (quick shout-out to Elspeth Conquers Death which does have reanimation as its third chapter and is a powerhouse of removal and disruption on its front half) Of course, to fuel our reanimation strategy we’ll need ways to fill our graveyard. The two best options are discard effects or self-mill. Self-mill will put us at least in Golgari, maybe Sultai, depending on how deep we go. If you want a better look at what options there are, check out my Titan’s Nest article. The Binding of the Titans is strong in green, Tymaret Calls the Dead in black, and Merfolk Secretkeeper in blue, amongst others. Gyruda, Doom of Depths does the milling and the reanimating for us all in one, though it is on the higher end in terms of cost and commitment to an all-in strategy. Discard would likely employ red, making us Jund. Cathartic Reunion and Thirst for Meaning both turbo charge our graveyard. For a more in-depth discussion, check out my Offspring’s Revenge article. Money for Nuthin’ and Greatwurms for Free But reanimation is not the only way to cheat Impervious Greatwurm into play. Some cards allow us to forgo casting costs and utilizing other zones: move card directly from hand to field, pass GO, collect $200 and a 16/16 indestructible wurm. In older formats, Show and Tell , Sneak Attack , and Through the Breach have been putting Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Griselbrand directly into play for years, why can’t we have the same fun in Standard? Here is where the pickings start to get, not necessarily slim, but extremely conditional. If you like to roll the dice, activating a Dreamshaper Shaman or down-ticking a Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast is a viable path. Even spicier would be mutating an Auspicious Starrix or Illuna, Apex of Wishes . In all these cases, the deck-building would have to be precise, but you could make it so you hit an Impervious Greatwurm consistently. Most similar to the powerhouses of old are Purphoros, Bronze-Blooded and Ilharg, the Raze-Boar . Purphoros is basically a Sneak Attack on a stick, though having to sacrifice our monstrosity end of turn has always been problematic if we aren’t winning on the spot. Ilharg could be even better as it is a recur-able way to get the wurm into combat, and instead of sacrificing it, returns it to our hand, which sort of protects it. Still, both aren’t the most fool-proof ways to execute our gameplan. Lastly, if you want to play a more controlling game, Flood of Tears could be a lot of fun. Not only is it a great defensive card, but sometimes we’ll get to set down our Greatwurm and set up an offensive. Imagine all this with Teferi, Time Raveler ’s up-tick so you can Flood on the end of our opponent’s turn? Absolutely despicable and I love it. Annelid Aggression Now that I’ve gone on entirely too long about how to actually get Impervious Greatwurm into play, we need to discuss how to win. You might have noticed that one important word was missing from its textbox: trample. Not being able to bypass defenses means people can chump for days and potentially crack back or find an exile or bounce spell. That’s no bueno for us. We could give our Greatwurm a trample counter with Hornbash Mentor or Fully Grown though I doubt those would synergize with the rest of our deck no matter which way we took it. Cycling a Titanoth Rex could actually be beneficial if we were going for a reanimation strategy. T Rex isn’t as big as Greatwurm, but he’ll get the job done if we need him. Auras and equipment can also grant trample. Shadowspear is a versatile card and Setessan Training is cheap and fits the bill perfectly (and it helps make a case for Rise to Glory). Planeswalkers are always powerful inclusions to any deck and The Royal Scions or Vivien, Arkbow Ranger can give our wurm trample for the turn. Both seem to provide enough all-around utility to justify inclusion. There are also creatures who grant trample upon ETB, End-Raze Forerunners being the biggest and baddest. Since we’re already trying to cheapen our Greatwurm, I doubt we want to have to wait an extra turn and pay full price for these bigger tramplers, and if you’re invoking the End-Raze, you’re probably winning anyway. Now, all of these options are plausible, though some more efficient and less far-fetched than others. However, I’m saving what I feel to be the most fool-proof win condition for last. Why bother with trample (we didn’t even discuss unblockability, but trust me that’s an even more convoluted road) when we can go straight to the opponent’s dome? Allow me to introduce a humble two mana red sorcery: Fling . Yes, that’s what this has come to. After all that grandstanding about Impervious Greatwurm getting more love and recognition, we’re sacrificing him for the greater good, martyred for the sake of us climbing the ladder. And that, my friends, is a metaphor, or maybe an actual example of how life isn’t fair. Here’s a build that I put together utilizing the discussion in this article while pushing the envelope even further.

It’s situations like these that we live for here at Hexdrinkers; ignoring the norm and blazing paths in the face of the unknown (I’ve been reading Brandon Sanderson recently, cut me some slack for my bombast). These changes don’t kill all the top-tier decks, and many might flock to the safer tried-and-true strategies emerging from their Companion Winter hibernation, but we at Hexdrinkers like to keep looking forward. A shakeup like this provides opportunities to get wild before things settle into place. Without further adieu, welcome to a two-for-one edition of Homebrewed. You Know I Keep That Thang On Me Creatures 4x Acclaimed Contender 3x Dalakos, Crafter of Wonders 4x Fervent Champion 4x Renowned Weaponsmith 4x Stonecoil Serpent 4x Stormfist Crusader 3x Syr Gwyn, Hero of Ashvale Artifacts 2x Colossus Hammer 4x Embercleave 3x Shadowspear 2x Steelclaw Lance Lands 3x Blood Crypt 2x Fabled Passage 1x Godless Shrine 1x Hallowed Fountain 1x Island 2x Mountain 1x Plains 1x Sacred Foundry 3x Steam Vents 2x Swamp 4x Tournament Grounds 2x Watery Grave This deck originally started with me wanting to do something silly with Colossus Hammer . But looking further into the cardpool, there are some interesting and powerful cards pertaining to equipment in the format. Let’s start by discussing with the actual equipment we’ll be using to pound our opponent’s face in. Tools of the Trade Our armory only consists of four different cards, but they all serve an important purpose. Steelclaw Lance is the blue collar equipment for our deck, but it’s rate as well as sizeable buff means combat is going to be in our favor. Its (much) bigger brother, Colossus Hammer , is arguably a meme cards, but that doesn’t mean it’s gonna stop me from trying to suit somebody up with this and go to town (in all honesty it makes me more likely to do that). It, along with the proven powerhouse, Embercleave , are our best ways of taking our opponent from 20 to zero. To combat any retaliation and wrought divine wrath, we have Shadowspear to cover our bases. Though it’s seen mostly sideboard play since it escaped from the underworld, don’t underestimate it. Between being incredibly cheap to cast and equip and for an aggressive deck like this and giving a creature trample and lifelink to punch through damage while helping us outpace other aggro strategies really helps this gem shine. The anti-hexproof/indestructible ability doesn’t come into play often, but every once in a while it’s clutch, which is just icing on the cake. So those are the knives we’re bringing to the standard gunfight. Now let’s discuss choosing who will fulfill the prophecy and pull them from the sacred stones. We’re the Knights of the Round Table, We Equip When’re We’re Able In order to secure our kingdom, we’ve brought together several powerful knights who curve nicely into each other for a brutal offense. Leading the charge is Fervent Champion . A staple in mono-red decks since their release goes about as fast as you can go. And once multiple attack together the threat level increases even further. However, Fervent Champion has another clause that most people either ignore or don’t even know about: “Equip abilities that target Fervent Champion cost three generic less to activate.” Full stop. That means that cards like Steelclaw Lance, Shadowspear, and an Embercleave that needs to be moved over all equip for free (oh, and that’s also a big chunk off equipping Colossus Hammer)… … all of which we can grab with Acclaimed Contender . I suppose we can’t have anything on the rate of Goblin Ringleader these days, but we’ll take the Contender as they can grab us either another body or an equipment, if our board is in good shape. A full playset of these will help us sift through our deck at a quicker clip and keep the pressure on. But I did say we were curving nicely, so don’t think I forgot the two-drop slot. To compliment Acclaimed Contender’s digging we have Stormfist Crusader as continual source of card draw, impressive in a Mardu tribe (Note: not exactly known for drawing cards). Plus, a 2/2 menace for two ain’t too shabby. Sure our opponent also draws a card, but they’re taking damage and they sure aren’t going to outrace us. Recently brainwashed and conscripted by the evil forces of Rakdos Sacrifice, let’s bring this defender of the realm back to the side of justice. Lastly, commanding our forces is the majestic, Syr Gwyn, Hero of Ashvale . Though once a hero, but she’s been forced to take an early retirement. Not even Brawl players have taken to this card (probably due to the fact that it costs six, c’mon Wizards you could’ve pushed this card a bit as opposed to so many others), so it’s up to us here at Hexdrinkers to find Syr Gwyn a home (nudge nudge Chev, get on it). Once we can get her onto the field, the Hero of Ashvale is an absolute beast with sizable stats and excellent keywords. Even more importantly she gives us free equips (the Colossus Hammer dream shines a bit brighter) and more card advantage, which is crucial to push a deck like this across the finish line. Rise, and become a Hero once more in our crusade upon a new Standard format! That’s a capable and sizable army that we’ve recruited, but every army needs support staff; medics, squires, and most importantly, blacksmiths, all round out a successful war effort. Our forces are no different. Manning the forges today are two masters of their craft. So many equipment through the years just weren’t viable due to a high mana cost, high equip cost or a combination of both, but no longer. With Dalakos, Crafter of Wonders and Renowned Weaponsmith , we can expedite the forging and fitting of our steel. Dalakos also must put a little extra spice into his blades giving those who wield them the ability to zoom into the sky providing much needed evasion and speed; he gives them flying and haste. Begrudgingly, ‘flaste’ doesn’t sound as good as ‘flample’ (flying+trample). But how else are these knights suppose to slay dragons? In addition to weapons, our craftsmen have whipped up something a little more sentient and just as deadly. Stonecoil Serpent can be fueled by both Dalakos and R.W., growing to preposterous sizes, and can hold back flyers and multicolored threats all day (looking at you Dream Trawler ). Another welcome addition to the front lines. That’s the deck, a nice twist on an aggro deck incorporating a recently overlooked tribe and card type. In this new standard aggro decks will be especially potent, so this deck is an out of the box to approach the format. But if you thought that’s all for today, you’re mistaken good friends. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I only gave you one option, so I’ve prepared another deck with not Eldraine at its core, but Theros! This one is another aggro deck because there’s something cathartic about hitting “All Attack” on Arena. Zero to Hero Artifacts 3x Embercleave Creatures 2x Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice 3x Hero of the Games 3x Hero of the Nyxborn 4x Hero of the Pride 1x Heroes of the Revel 4x Hero of the Winds Enchantments 1x Conclave Tribunal 2x Omen of the Sun Instants 3x Fight as One 3x Gods Willing 2x Unbreakable Formation 4x Raise the Alarm Sorceries 2x Forbidden Friendship 2x Swallow Whole Lands 2x Castle Ardenvale 2x Castle Embereth 6x Mountain 9x Plains 4x Sacred Foundry Theros Beyond Death had this series of ‘Hero’ cards that made one helluva Boros aggro deck in draft. With all the auras in the set you could suit up a Hero and what I’d like to dub the ‘Hero Clause’ (a nod to original Theros’s ‘Heroic’ mechanic) kicks in buffing your whole team. It’s like in any superhero movie where at the edge of defeat, the leader of {insert your favorite named assemblage of superheroes} gives their rousing speech about not giving up and the power of friendship and working together and every gets their energy back plus more to defeat the baddies. Or maybe that was the plot of every Shounen anime ever… Anyway! I thought, why assemble the greatest version of this draft deck ever made and take a whole legion of heroes to war in Standard. And you know how it goes over here at Hexdrinkers, once that thought takes shape, we have to deliver it to y’all, fully fleshed out. With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility Our creature suite is very streamlined as they’re almost all Heroes. This means they’re a red or white creature that has the Hero Clause: whenever you cast a spell that targets this creature, creatures you control get +1/+0. Wizards has conveniently printed a bevy of heroes for us that curve out nicely. Hero of the Pride , into Hero of the Nyxborn / Hero of the Games , into Hero of the Winds , into Heroes of the Revel ? Yes please. And every great Hero has a sidekick (or several). We are no different, so we want a lot of buddies for our heroes. Heroes of the Revel and Hero of the Nyxborn already provide us an extra body apiece. We’re also running Raise the Alarm , Forbidden Friendship , and Omen of the Sun . Each provides a great ratio of mana invested to bodies and instant speed lets us ambush as well as set up a sneak attack. Lastly, we need ways to target our Heroes so we can beef up our team. Gods Willing is a great way to blank removal spells, win stalemates in combat, or even potentially sneak past blocks. Fight as One protects and buffs our creatures and we have a good balance of human and non-humans so we can utilize both modes. Swallow Whole is a sneaky pick as not only does it remove dangers across the battlefield (and synergizing with our token generation; tapping a creature isn’t a downside when you have so many), but it also targets our creatures so we can buff them! Double whammy, baby. Round out the deck with some extra punch in Embercleave , some protection in Unbreakable Formation , and a battle-hardened general, Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice and you’re ready to bring peace and order to the multiverse! Brave New World The recent bannings and rules change have shaken up many formats, especially Standard. The format has been busted wide open in the chaos. It’s time to try new things, have fun brewing, and of course, smash face. That’s it for this installment of Homebrewed! These decks were fun to craft and I hope y’all pour yourselves a frothing mug of ale, take them into the queues, and fight the good fight. Stay tuned for more content (M21 spoilers inbound), stay loving life, and stay brewing!

I promised y’all last time that we’d play this cycling deck, so let’s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt; This deck is swift as a coursing river and packs all the force of a great typhoon (not a shark typhoon though, that doesn’t cycle for one mana). It also has all the strength of a raging fire, but dammit it’s not mysterious as the dark side of the moon! It’s basic and trash. And so am I. Real talk this deck is dumb, but it’s fun to play and that’s all that matters. If you’re drinking with this deck, please relegate yourself to a Truly (an inferior seltzer to White Claw) or Natty Light (which might just be water), you don’t deserve any better. Editor’s Note: Chev here, this deck brought Julian to Platinum so don’t listen to a word he says. If you want to give this deck a go, get yourself some freaking Champagne and don’t let nobody tell you different. Least of all this dude.

Now, I know I said I would do whatever the winner of our poll was but…as of writing, it’s tied. I’ll give that another week to simmer and instead celebrate the release of a new legendary creature to our fair format, courtesy of this month’s Brawl Guildhall! Give it up forrrrrrrrr Hanna, Ship’s Navigator!&lt;/p&gt; Originally appearing in Invasion, Hanna has a long legacy with the game in both lore and Brawl’s big brother Commander. For you more enfranchised players, I can already see your grins widening at the notion of repeatable graveyard recursion. One only needs to glance at her EDHRec Page to see the potential of constantly having access to a Seal of Cleansing , Cataclysmic Gearhulk , or even nastier. Most Hanna builds are controlling, limiting opponents’ resources while you build up a pillow fort. The ability to bring back threats like Wurmcoil Engine over and over again…well that’s generally icing on the cake. So what happens when you try to port a similar strategy to Brawl? Hit me Baby One More Time Hanna’s power is going to come from her flexibility in getting whatever piece of tech you need at the current moment from the yard. Need to make a substantial threat for an easy 5 mana? One activation and an All that Glitters got you covered. Need protection? How about reanimating an Alseid of Life’s Bounty ? Be they your Banishing Light or Staggering Insight , having access to your best pieces over and over again is incredibly powerful. While we will be recurring a few deadly artifacts like Meteor Golem and Crystalline Giant , our main focus will be on enchantments since TBD has such an incredible amount of support for that theme. So, what enchantments benefit the most coming back from the yard? An Enchanted Return Ashiok’s Erasure is probably not what comes to anyone’s mind when they think “counter spell”. It’s four mana, doesn’t fully destroy the spell, and feels a little clunky. I mean it’s an Oblivion Ring for spells. However, as we found out in our previous build (see link below), not only are the Oblivion Rings and Heliod’s Punishment of the format better than we gave them credit for, not a lot of people are running artifact or enchantment removal. So now we’re talking about a card that will exile a potential threat and hey if this gets axed, we can do it again! I’m actually not sure if this is worth including over another counterspell, so if you’re looking for things to tweak this is a fair target. However, in honor of our commander I feel there is a significant thematic boost to including this wild card. Shark Typhoon is really a perfect example of a Hanna target. If Shark Typhoon is played as an enchantment your opponent can relive the terror (cheesy, but terror nonetheless) of Sharknado. If you just need a really big flying shark (and really who doesn’t), cycle it and prepare to bring it back with Hanna. All Sharks all the time. The Birth of Meletis highlights another key category of cards in our deck: sagas. These enchantments have a limited lifespan, meaning as soon as Hanna is ready we’ll have the ability to start them right over. Coming in at two mana, The Birth of Meletis is certainly the cheapest Saga we have and most likely to be replayed in a consistent fashion. Searching for a land, creating bodies, and gaining a little life is a consistent set of abilities that can’t win on their own…but certainly provide the grease in our recursion machine to keep us in longer games. Banishing Light has all the same talking points as Ashiok’s Erasure. It removes a threat from the board and can be a potential target for Hanna if it ends up in the graveyard. Brawl is a format of big monsters, and removal always comes at a premium. Not much more to say about this powerhouse besides it’s an effect we’re quadrupling up on between Conclave Tribunal , Heliod’s Punishment , and Prison Realm . Junk Diving Moving on to potential artifact targets, we don’t have many but each fills a very necessary slot for any Brawl deck. We have: graveyard hate, removal, and terrifying threats. What more could you ask for?! Nothing. This is perfect and I love them all. Soul-Guide Lantern fills a familiar role to anyone who’s seen our Brawl builds before: hating on those nasty graveyards. All graveyard strategies are bogus unless we’re the ones currently using it and being able to target a sneaky Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath or Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger is an incredible benefit. Get out of here with your shenanigans. Also, in a build like this one we might actually be able to use the Lantern’s second mode and use it to draw the occasional card or two. I doubt you’ll be able to create an endless cycle, but it’s nice to know you have the option. Meteor Golem will obliterate anything. No questions asked. Best case, your opponent takes out their vengeance on it’s relatively minor 3/3 body or you can chump, putting Meteor Golem right into the graveyard for Hanna to pick up. Crystalline Giant is just a rude card. Slowly building up into an absolute beast or maybe trading as soon as it gets deathtouch. Either way, I’d expect this to be brought back multiple times a game. Other Notable Set Pieces Outside of recursion targets, our deck needs a few other powerful payoff cards to build up to. We can’t just rely on our removal and disruption because… well, that’s no fun. We’re playing Brawl, we’re here to fight and take names. So that being said, meet the opponent-might-concede bombs we’re packing. Dance of the Manse is our other big payoff for filling the yard with artifacts and enchantments. Unlike Hanna, Dance brings them all back directly to the battlefield. baBOOM! That’s right, we’ll flood the board with used removal, sagas, and one or two artifacts that have the chance to also become an army of 4/4s. Come at us. It should also be noted that any auras returned with Dance like Heliod’s Punishment or Ichthyomorphosis can get around some pesky punk with hexproof. I don’t see this being a big thing, but it’s worth pointing out! Out-tech your opponents! Anyway, I see Dance as the be-all finisher card that the rest of your deck spends the game preparing to cast. Cavalier of Dawn serves as another piece of non-conditional removal, maybe giving our opponent a 3/3 golem or…remember a couple turns ago when you used Banishing Light on their commander? Commander’s back in the zone, and your enchantment is just sitting on the battlefield with nothing to do. So target that, get a 3/3 Golem for yourself and the ability to exile something else in a couple turns! The most excellent of value. It’s almost too good with the added death trigger allowing you to bring something back to your hand for free. This is easily one of my favorite cards in the deck when played right. Kiora Bests the Sea God needs no write-up or speech convincing you why you should include it. 8/8 Hexproof Threat, Tap everything down, and if they’re not dead by then…steal their commander. This will end games, and if it doesn’t, I’m pretty sure your opponent won’t want to stick around for round two. So that’s it! Let’s see what this deck can get up to! Hanna, Ship&#39;s Navigator Enchantments Creatures 1x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 1x Arcanist&#39;s Owl 1x Callaphe, Beloved of the Sea 1x Cavalier of Dawn 1x Crystalline Giant 1x Meteor Golem 1x Starfield Mystic 1x Transcendent Envoy Lands 1x Command Tower 1x Emergence Zone 1x Fabled Passage 1x Hallowed Fountain 10x Island 11x Plains 1x Temple of Enlightenment 1x Tranquil Cove Sorceries 1x Bond of Insight 1x Dance of the Manse 1x Swallow Whole Planeswalkers 1x Kasmina, Enigmatic Mentor Enchantments 1x All That Glitters 1x Ashiok&#39;s Erasure 1x Banishing Light 1x Conclave Tribunal 1x Elspeth Conquers Death 1x Heliod&#39;s Punishment 1x Ichthyomorphosis 1x Kiora Bests the Sea God 1x Mirrormade 1x Omen of the Sea 1x Prison Realm 1x Shark Typhoon 1x Staggering Insight 1x The Birth of Meletis Instants 1x Dovin&#39;s Veto 1x Keep Safe 1x Neutralize 1x Thirst For Meaning Artifacts 1x Arcane Signet 1x Soul-Guide Lantern Conclusions For better or worse, the game has evolved since Hanna first came on the scene. What seems like a pretty powerful ability at first glance may not be as strong as you thought it was. For starters, Hanna needs to see untap before she can even get to her recursion shenanigans and most often commanders are either killed on sight, or countered (which is even worse when it’s Tale’s End ). Then, her ability can only be activated once per turn without significant help and you’ll still need to cast whatever you get back. Compared to the likes of Muldrotha, the Gravetide , this seems incredibly too slow in 1v1. It also makes everything that does provide immediate value, through ETBs or being a blocker, far more enticing to cast each turn. Why play a 1/2 that can do something next turn when I can drop a Crystalline Giant that will upgrade on the turn I play it? This deck went 4-1, but on only one of those wins was Hanna even a factor. Most of the time it was the UW shell that beat our opponents down long enough to either draw a threat or until they concede having no more threats to play. In fact, our one loss came from looking down the barrel of a more modern artifact/enchantment commander who was able to provide utility immediately to her growing army: Alela, Artful Provocateur . Losing the ability to bring back a couple enchantments per game is made up for in spades with access to black and generating a flying army of fairies that slowly prick you to death. Hanna just couldn’t keep up. Two games were won in part by Crystalline Giant with an All That Glitters , either by becoming an 11/11 flyer with first strike and deathtouch or an…11/11 flyer with first strike and a very lucky Kiora bests the sea god tapping all their creatures. I will give a special highlight to the final game, the one where Hanna actually came out to whoop some ass. It was against Snapdax, Apex of the Hunt and we had set up this beautiful board of Hanna, The Birth of Meletis , and a couple removal spells systematically taking down each potential Snapdax mutate target. Once our Elspeth Conquers Death hit the graveyard and was targeted by a Hanna activation the opponent scooped fearing the constant loop of being conquered ad nauseum. Woohoo! I think Elspeth would be proud of that one. So overall, this was a good build of UW Enchantment Control that was able to successfully limit the threats of our opponents until we could come up with a win con. While it’s not what I’m typically looking for, it was a lot of fun to play. Hanna kind of served as a nice bonus when she worked, but overall it feels like magic has passed her by. Hopefully she sees a powerful reboot much like the rest of the Weatherlight crew! So until next time! Enter The Guildhall &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Flight of the Navigator (Brawl)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/05/28/brawldt_2.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;an introduction to brawl&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/05/28/brawl_primer.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/3/f/3f4e783c-0717-4127-bd7b-885ca617ca29.jpg?1562380385&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;An Introduction to Brawl&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Enter The Guildhall&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, you want to hear a story eh? Legendary heroes battling for supremacy using their might and wisdom and general badassery? Sit down, grab a drink. It’s time to learn about Brawl.&lt;/p&gt; No, not that one. Get outta here, this is a Magic site. We’re talking Brawl the format (although I’d completely understand if more of you were familiar with the former.) My love for Brawl started at the Dominaria prerelease. It was just after the format was introduced and Dominaria was built for Brawl on a fundamental level. Each pack had a dedicated legendary slot, and the prerelease box came with an extra date-stamped legendary. Originally, I had chalked up Brawl as a one-off way for Wizards to bring the Commander community into the rotating Standard environment and saw Brawl support just as a way to level up some of my 99-card decks…but as I flipped through those six packs of cards, my mind just started forming connections. A limited cardpool lacking “staples” can breed creativity. I found myself drowning in potential options and was mentally sorting cards into build categories for at least half the deck construction time and spent the rest of the prerelease scheming potential decks in the back of my head. I’m going to pretend that the preoccupation with potential Brawl builds is why I walked away from the event without a win to my name. But who cares!!! I knew exactly what I needed to structure a Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive deck OR how I planned to trade my friend Harrison for his Josu Vess, Lich Knight to aide Aryel, Knight of Windgrace in knight tribal. After leaving the event, I spent the entire walk home trying to convince my friends to give Brawl a shot. Considering half of them had never even played Magic before that day, I knew I might be facing an uphill battle…but the resistance never came. Maybe it’s the casual nature of multiplayer magic where all four of us could just sit down with a beer or two after a day of class and sling spells at each other. It could also have been the powerful narrative of choosing a specialized general to lead your troops into battle. Either way we all agreed to give it a shot. I was ecstatic. I met all these guys while studying abroad in New Zealand that semester, so even those of us who had some experience with the game were in a position where no one had any collection of cards to fall back on. Initially, we all just had those prerelease packs. This was incredibly fortunate for the budding playgroup to start on such equal footing, and allowed us to really experiment with combos of cards that otherwise would have seemed ridiculous. Eventually we found a local game store that would give draft chaff to students for free, and maybe we bought a pack or two…but singles were pretty much out of the question. I felt such a strong connection to when my friends back home and I had just started playing in High School. Both metas were defined by low-powered decks with one or two mid-tier rares that were absolutely devastating when dropped. Things like Helm of the Host or Siege-Gang Commander were among the biggest game-ending threats if they were allowed to get out of hand. Luckily this time around, everyone was able to skip the stage of only playing the coolest threats without any answers. If I were to list my all-time favorite Magic memories, that semester in New Zealand playing with low-powered brawl decks would easily be in the top three. It was really a testament to what crafty strategies we could build from the limited pool we had. To give an example of one of my sweetest creations, here is a selection from my Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive deck that’s still one of my favorite builds to this day. Any equipment that gave just a boost to power was an instant include, making my wild army of blue 2/1s into actual threats (as long as Tetsuko was on the field), and Champion of Wits served as a sweet piece of late game tech to loot away any nasty lands while serving as a reasonable body in the early game. Considering how fragile my army was, there were also a fair number of counterspells like Unwind or Wizard’s retort , much to everyone else’s chagrin. Hey! Man’s gotta protect his army of ninjas, am I right?! The group eventually coalesced around Darigaaz, Reincarnated , Hallar, the Fire Fletcher , Slimefoot, the Stowaway , and Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive . We’d all gather round a booth in the lobby of our student housing with maybe a beer or soda from the machine and spend the night laughing at the absurdity of being slowly whittled down by a Graven Abomination until someone could draw an Abrade . Then, maybe we’d go down to Burger Fuel for a bite or end up doing a bit of group studying. It was the perfect pressure release and a time dedicated to seeing friends amongst everyone’s busy schedules. After that initial Dominaria hype, the community’s love for Brawl also drastically declined. There were a few powerhouse cards that needed to be banned, (see: Baral, Chief of Compliance ) and Wizards had only pushed Brawl for that one set so support was severely lacking in Core 19 and Guilds of Ravnica. Sure, there were legendary creatures, but no excitement from the Mothership to spur innovative design in the format. I think one of the final nails in that early coffin was fall rotation, when all the commander players realized why a lot of them had drifted away from rotating formats in the first place…half their deck was no longer usable. But like all good things, eventually it came to an end. When I returned home, I really struggled to get any of my “killer” brawl designs upgraded into the commander meta. All the strategy and unique designs I’d spent months crafting didn’t really hold a candle to the more powered-up strategies of a legacy cardbase, and I found myself not really wanting to tarnish the memories I had with particular standard cards in favor of pushing a deck out. Since I didn’t have a brawl group anymore my interest in the format really petered, and it seems I wasn’t alone. Official Support didn’t return until Eldraine over a year later. This time, with preconstructed Brawl decks to really spur momentum. Most demand for these products ended up going towards Commander since at that point the Brawl player base was around two people. New staples like Arcane Signet and Tome of Legends instantly started popping up on EDHRec, but besides a couple articles the lasting Brawl impact wasn’t there. I don’t think many people even considered these cards for Brawl at the time. Maybe you’d play a few precon games with friends, but then you’d immediately turn Chulane, Teller of Tales into a beastly 100 card monstrosity. It really took the introduction of Brawl into Arena shortly after to give the format the jump it needed. Giving Commander players (and a budding Brawl community) a version of their favorite format online was an incredible selling point, and even though Wizards started small (only weekly events and some special occasions to play), the numbers wanting to line up behind their favorite legendary and throw hands only grew. That of course brings us to the present day. Now, Arena is only increasing its Brawl offerings from weekly queues to month-long events that give incredibly powerful legendaries from sets past their turn to completely rock the metagame. Stagnation is no longer something to associate with Brawl. Finally, two years after I dropped Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive for the first time, Brawl is getting the recognition it deserves. Alright I’m Hooked, What are the Specifics? Brawl’s official announcement from WOTC can be found here. TLDR: You build a 60 card singleton deck (the deck can only have one copy of each card besides basic lands), with one powerful legendary creature or planeswalker as your “commander” who starts outside the game. Think of this legendary character as the general of your forces. The best brawl decks build around the effects of their commander to create a synergy that benefits from constant access to your commander who starts essentially as an eighth card in hand. Also, being a singleton format you only ever need one copy of any given card. This becomes a huge boon when looking at MTGA’s wildcard structure. You don’t really want to be spending 4 wildcards on a playset of Breeding Pool s, right? Sure they’re cool but you’d rather save your redeems for Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath or Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy . It gives a lot more flexibility on how to spend your hard-earned wins when you don’t need to buy 4-ofs to be competitive. That should not dissuade enfranchised players though.The singleton nature of the format creates a landscape much harder to solve since it lacks the consistency of other 60-card formats. Finding ways to enact a successful game plan across multiple matches is an incredible puzzle to solve. Brawl’s Official Rules Unlike Commander, whose rules are handled by an external entity to Wizards, The Rules Committee, Wizards handles Brawl in-house and can provide the most in-depth description of the various mechanical specifics here. Brawl functions almost exactly like Commander, so if you’re a recent convert from Brawl’s big older brother the TLDR is your commander can be either a standard-legal legendary creature OR Planeswalker, and the starting life total for 1-on-1 is 25. It goes up to 30 for games of more than 2 people which I did not know…until I was doing research for this article. For those of you more unfamiliar with Commander… Your Commander is a Legendary Creature or Planeswalker who starts outside the game, meaning your initial deck is only 59 cards. All cards in your deck must fit into the color identity of your Commander. If your commander is a Simic creature, all spells in your deck must be blue, green, both, or colorless. The easy way to check this is if any other mana symbol outside of what’s on your commander shows up ANYWHERE on a card - you can’t use it. MTGA will also help and notify you of illegal cards if you choose one. Your first mulligan is free, so the first time you decide to shuffle your hand back into your deck - you draw seven cards again. After that, it follows normal London Mulligan rules Perhaps the biggest new concept is this idea of the “Command Zone” i.e. where your Commander starts the game. Basically, it’s a special place where you can cast your commander from any time you could cast them from your hand. The benefit is, any time your commander would be moved from one zone to another (battlefield to exile, graveyard to exile, hand to graveyard, etc.) …you can choose to have them sent BACK to the Command zone instead! Making sure you always have access to what is probably your greatest weapon. Now, this does come at a cost though: Each time your commander is sent back to the command zone, it’ll cost two more generic mana to cast the next time. This is called Commander Tax and balances some of the benefit of always having your commander accessible. Brewing Since Brawl is a much newer format than Commander, and due to the lack of content produced in 2019 until Eldraine about the format…there aren’t nearly as many resources available if you’re looking for ideas. Initially, EDHRec had an entire site dedicated to Brawl but as of right now that still hasn’t come back. Luckily, MTGGoldfish and a couple others can offer some ideas on what people are currently playing. I’d be careful starting with a net deck though! It can be difficult to make your own connections between cards after seeing something you might consider as “better.” Always scheme out your own idea first, maybe focusing on just cards already in your collection - and use these sites as ways to upgrade or add new things. Or, if you really just want to jump in at a competitive level all decks on MTGGoldfish are listed with their popularity in the current meta. Once you have a Commander in mind…Here are some tips that might help you on your journey to build the ultimate 60-card temple to badassitude. Your Commander should be built around: With the recent focus on legendary creatures to the benefit of both Commander and Brawl, there are a huge selection of generals to choose from - and your deck should hone in on what your commander does best. Goodstuff is a viable strategy, but generally building something that focuses on your Commander’s unique identity will benefit you even more. For example, recently I’ve started building a Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy deck to try out new stuff from Ikoria. Since Kinnan boosts the power of anything that isn’t a land tapping for mana by crazy amounts that was a big emphasis in my design process. Normally in Simic I wouldn’t think Chromatic Lantern , Heraldic Banner , or Midnight Clock necessary - but their added utility to make bonkers mana makes them stand out far more than normal. Another example is with Siona, Captain of the Pyleas . Hopefully you can tell Siona really wants to be in a deck with a high amount of auras and enchantments…but don’t forget that second clause of token generation! Maybe it’s not your main theme…but throwing in a Divine Visitation and maybe one or two other token generators might not be a bad use for a couple slots! Take notes of what cards you see other people playing: In a vein of “learn from your mistakes,” the brawl meta is so incredibly different from Standard that even if you’ve been playing standard for quite some time - cards are going to come up you had no idea existed. Maybe you’ve come up with a sick General Kudro of Drannith deck when someone drops a General’s Enforcer …Write that down! I hadn’t even considered Jiang Yanggu, Wildcrafter for my Kinnan deck until someone else turned their entire board into mana dorks that each tap for two and allowed their Kinnan to go off several times a turn! That game didn’t last long after… I’m also ashamed to admit that I had completely forgotten both Arcane Signet and Command Tower were in Arena until someone else played them. Actually, on that note…. Get Arcane Signet and Command Tower: You wouldn’t have gotten these in packs, but they’re so incredibly powerful and should probably go in every deck you make. Plus, they’re both commons and I cannot think of a more powerful impact that can be made by literally any other cards legal in the format. Get yourself some incredibly cheap mana fixing to offset the cost of buying/crafting a shock land. Take Rotation Into account: Brawl does have the same looming threat as Standard. Come Fall, how many of my cards will still be useful? This can be an incredibly annoying thought when first starting in the format but shouldn’t be something that you worry too much about. Apart from the occasional Historic Brawl event, maybe you do want to focus your efforts on including cards from Eldraine, Theros Beyond Death, and Ikoria. I will admit though, the sacrifice of one mythic wildcard for a Hydroid Krasis …is definitely one worth making. You still have like six months to enjoy its absurdity, and your deck would be better for it! Finally, watch streams! Like with any other format, you can learn a lot from watching other people play the Brawl decks they’ve meticulously created and care about - see synergies and ideas for their decks that you didn’t even think of. I suppose this is also the point where I should shamelessly plug our streams - where personally, I’ll be playing a fair bit of brawl in the coming days and hopefully this article will convince Julian to join in as well… Now go out, have fun, and let us know what you think!

Nowadays, these words could not be more true. If you have decided to venture into any format over the past month you probably noticed players bringing Companions to battle in record numbers. Powerhouses like Yorion, Sky Nomad , Keruga, the Macrosage , and Gyruda, Doom of Depths have dominated Standard, while much more sinister companions have reached into older formats. Lurrus of the Dream-Den has already gone so far as to have been banned in Legacy AND Vintage. (Note, Lurrus is the only card in Vintage banned for power level. Yeah.) With Companions being ubiquitous in Magic today (and what appears to be a sweeping ban announcement on the horizon), I decided to adopt the “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em” mindset and give a speculative final hurrah to one lucky Ikorian. Today’s Companion of choice is none of those I’ve mentioned above. However, it shares a spot with Lurrus as the only other Companion to have faced a ban so far: Zirda, the Dawnwaker . Like a Normal Fox, but Spicier Zirda is my personal favorite of all the companions. First, this fox is hella cute. If it wasn’t made of fire, I’d wanna be cuddling it pronto. Zirda also encourages activated abilities which I think are an underrated and underutilised part of magic. People want the instant gratification of an ETB, but properly building around activated abilities can accrue a crushing amount of advantage turn after turn. Lastly, Zirda is a Boros Commander who doesn’t care about the combat step.. okay maybe a little considered its own ability, but it doesn’t scream, “Attack Attack Attack” like an Aurelia, the Warleader or Tajic, Blade of the Legion . I like Wizards exploring design space outside of the red-zone for Boros, which is arguably the worst color pair in EDH. I love Commander and I might do a series on making Boros great again, but this article is about Standard, so let us (let me) refocus. As I said, Zirda, like Lurrus, has a banning under its belt. It was recently stricken from Legacy likely due to the prevalence of Grim Monolith and Basalt Monolith allowing for infinite mana, which tends to win games. Since we’re adhering to the motto of ‘joining’ not ‘beating’, infinite mana sounds like a good idea to me too! “But Julian,” you may be asking yourself, “surely if there was an easy way to go infinite in Standard, we would have already seen it!” The answer is elementary, my dear Watsons. There isn’t an easy way, but there is a way. Real talk, it took me a few whole days of research to put the combo of making infinite mana together and then another couple days to put together some ways to win with it. Zi’Rube’da Goldberg First let’s discuss the combo itself. Just like Zirda’s interaction with the monoliths, or looking to cards like Training Grounds , the key to generating infinite mana is a loop of tapping and untapping that will net you mana each iteration. The only card in Standard that allows this iterative ability of untapping is this uncommon gem from Core Set M20: Gauntlets of Light . Now, as much as the Hexdrinkers appreciates big butts, we only care about the second clause: the untap ability for two and a white. Three mana is a bit much to pay to untap though, luckily Zirda gives us a discount so we only need to pay one white mana to untap! But there are still a lot of unanswered questions… … like, where are we getting this white mana and what creatures are we untapping with it? Faeburrow Elder and Incubation Druid are two of the most versatile mana producers in standard. Not only can they produce any color you might need (and we are running four colors) but they both have the potential to tap for multiple mana. Faeburrow Elder taps for green and white just by itself and can add even more colors depending on what we have out. Incubation Druid can only get one color of mana at a time, but after it adapts it’s still a Gilded Lotus with legs, which is not shabby. Not to mention, Zirda’s static ability can give us an early adapt. So now we’ve assembled our combo. With Zirda and either Faeburrow Elder or an adapted Incubation Druid suited up with the Gauntlets of Light, we can tap for two or three (or four if we’re lucky) and then untap for a single white, netting us mana. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum. Excellent, we have as much mana as we could want in any combination of colors! Now what? Hulk Smash, Brush Wagg Almighty Brushwagg is a meme card, right? Wrong. The Brushwagg is the king of the Ikorian jungle and it is with his might that we shall conquer our enemies. You see, the Brushwagg may be small on the surface, but it hides untold power in the form of an activated ability pumping it into an absolute beater. With our combo we can have an arbitrarily (read, ‘infinitely’) large amount of mana which means we have an arbitrarily (read, ‘infinitely’) large Brushwagg. 20 life you say? The Brushwagg waits for no man, woman, or creature. With Ram Through , our Brushwagg can take the fight straight to our opponent by trampling through any poor excuse for a defense our opponent can muster with lethal damage. And this can all happen outside combat. The Brushwagg laughs at summoning sickness. And heavens forbid our opponent attempts to slay our Brushwagg, it can Fling itself, dragging them to hell with it. Where There’s a Wish, There’s a Way Now, some of you may have noticed the elephant in the room. Zirda, as a Companion, has a deck building restriction: all permanents in our starting deck must have activated abilities. Faeburrow Elder and Incubation Druid have their mana abilities. Brushwagg has its pump ability. But Gauntlets of Light… well, it gives the untap ability to the creature it enchants, so it doesn’t pass the test. But, as it is the linchpin of our combo, we need to find a loophole. What if, instead of it being in our starting deck, it were in our sideboard? That adheres to regulations. Now, we just have to retrieve it, and nobody does the job better than Fae of Wishes ! (people often forget they have an activated ability, but it comes in handy) Playing four Fae of Wishes to grab our Gauntlets from the sideboard may seem a little extra, but it’s necessary for the sake of the combo, which is admittedly extra in itself, but “you are what you brew” or however that saying goes. I did take this chance to utilize the sideboard a bit more and placed an additional copy of Fling and Ram Through there, as well as a Keep Safe to protect our combo and an Expansion//Explosion . Which, admittedly, is the best win condition for this deck, but I’ve lost to it enough that I have a grudge. Plus the Brushwagg is wayyyyyyy cooler. The rest of the deck is pretty straight forward. Shimmer of Possibility , Adventurous Impulse , and Incubation//Incongruity all find our combo pieces. Alseid of Life’s Bounty and Keep Safe protect our combo. Paradise Druid fixes our mana and wishes it was Faeburrow Elder or Incubation Druid. Definitely feel free to customize the sideboard with whatever silver bullets are appropriate, or just more redundancy. Admittedly, this deck is fragile. It’s built for finding our pieces consistently and quickly. Disruption is not our friend. Also, the one-of, or sideboard nature of our win conditions is a gamble that I had to take in order to make the deck run on all cylinders. Lastly, the manabase was hard to decide on since we’re playing four colors and our pieces are all over the spectrum. Luckily our dorks can fix our mana pretty good, so I’m not extremely concerned. Dawnest Before the Dark Companion Zirda, the Dawnwaker Creatures 4x Almighty Brushwagg 4x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 4x Fae of Wishes 4x Faeburrow Elder 4x Incubation Druid 4x Paradise Druid Instants 1x Fling 4x Incubation//Incongruity 1x Keep Safe 1x Ram Through Sorceries 4x Adventurous Impulse 3x Shimmer of Possibility Lands 1x Breeding Pool 2x Fabled Passage 6x Forest 2x Hallowed Fountain 2x Island 4x Ketria Triome 1x Plains 1x Sacred Foundry 1x Steam Vents 1x Stomping Ground 1x Temple Garden Sideboard 1x Expansion//Explosion 1x Fling 4x Gauntlets of Light 1x Keep Safe 1x Ram Through And that’s the deck! This one was a crazy puzzle to fit together and though I doubted its competitive viability, we did go 2-3! After getting beat down by super aggressive decks that went under us, getting that combo off for the first time was exhilarating. The second time was just as good because we fought our way through a Dream Trawler and TWO Agent of Treachery ’s. Ways to upgrade the deck would be better mana, though we didn’t really have any issues, and more consistent ways to find our pieces, though there aren’t really any tutors in Standard. Lastly, the only drink I recommend for this deck is one you’re comfortable pouring out for the looming loss of Zirda and all the Companions. Rev Your Engines will be returning soon with a real rager, so stay tuned, and stay brewing y’all!

Messing with the graveyard, self-milling, and being generally tricksy is right up Sultai’s alley. Now we swing to the opposite end of the spectrum with the most straight forward wedge, Mardu: lovers of bloodshed, conflict, and the thrill of the kill. And what’s even better than a bunch of bloodthirsty berserkers charging their foes? A bunch of bloodthirsty berserkers riding into battle on spike-studded motorcycles, Mad Max style! Rev Your Engines my brethren, for we’ll be riding into the Standard battlefield eternal, shiny, and chrome with the might of &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/iko/198/offsprings-revenge?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/7/8/78619ffb-f514-4f9f-9d77-3ab49e045f7c.jpg?1586457085&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Offspring’s Revenge &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Offspring’s Revenge illustrates a tale as old as time: the maturation of an orphan into a bloodthirsty killing machine swearing to avenge their fallen parent. It reminds me of what Bambi could have been if Disney weren’t cowards, or maybe more accurately, a little known Japanese animation called Ringing Bell. It’s the tale of a sheep who goes on a quest to avenge his mother who was killed by a wolf, becoming a savage ram who has horns like spears and actually duels the wolf in the end. Highly recommended, but I digress. You know what could’ve helped out our woodland friends? An enter-the-battlefield trigger. Which is precisely what we’re looking for. Offspring’s Revenge is an excellent way to rebuy ETBs and attack triggers since it gives our vengeful babies haste. The glaring downside of the tokens being 1/1’s is no longer so much of an issue if we can maximize these two types of triggers to our advantage. I did a LOT of research for this article and let’s just say that there is a ridiculous number of creatures in standard with ETBs (and a fair amount with attack triggers too). Overcome with options and ideas, I figured we would have our cake and eat it too and I prepare a buffet of decks to choose from: A dedicated Offspring’s Revenge deck that’s extra hateful A take on a known standard deck, Mono-Black, utilizing Offspring’s Revenge , and A five color pile that pushes the boundaries of what we can reanimate (and the boundaries of functional deck building) Revenge is a Dish Best Served … Not cold. No, we want it flaming hot, so we’re serving up some burn. And the king of burn in this Standard format is the big three-headed dragon himself Drakuseth, Maw of flames . Drakuseth costs a fat seven mana, so instead of paying mana like an honest spellslinger let’s reanimate the big scaly bastard. Oh, and he has haste, so we’ll be dealing three and three and four, immediately. Drakuseth is great for gunning down our opponents creatures, whether that’s blockers, utility, or ones who’ll crack back at us. Drakuseth’s molten buddy tectonic giant is also joining the fray. It can go to our opponents dome on attack and is fine to be played out normally. Then, it can be recycled later after biting the dust for maximum value. Plus, the card advantage on tectonic giant ’s other attack trigger is underrated and recommended in games where your momentum is slowing. Like I mentioned earlier, the creatures we’re “reanimating” with Offspring’s Revenge are 1/1’s so we need a way to limit our opponents ability to go over us. One way to do that is if they don’t have any cards to play! (Yup, that math checks out - Chev) Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger and Basilica Bell Haunt both strip resources from our opponent and put us ahead on life totals. Like Tectonic Giant , both want to be run out early and then re-utilized later in the game. Kroxa especially, as it’ll put itself right in the graveyard for us. Keep in mind Kroxa will sacrifice itself if we get it with Offspring’s Revenge so escaping it can be favorable as well. Another way to maintain our onslaught is by blowing up our opponent’s stuff (duh, that’s like magic 101 Jules). Cavalier of Dawn and his friend Cavalier of Night are both happy to help. Dawn will pop any problematic noncreature permanents (say, a Teferi, Time Raveler ) and can easily tangle with the 3/3 left behind. Night will smite down any opposing fatties at the cost of one of our creatures, which we either want to recur anyway, or…. Is a 1/1 token that we already got a trigger off. Acceptable losses. Finally comes Plaguecrafter , a catch-all answer that can pick off a creature, planeswalker, or take another card out of our opponents hand. Also, since we’ll usually be sacrificing Plaguecrafter to his own trigger, he’s immediately ready for us to use again from the grave, similar to Kroxa. These are all great targets for our centerpiece enchantment, but most of these cards won’t get to the graveyard on their own! The gasoline to fuel our revengine (see what I did there?) comes in the form of classic red rummaging. Cathartic Reunion and Thrill of Possibility are both instant includes, filling our graveyard with targets and improving the consistency of our draws. Heartwarming Redemption is a one-sided pseudo- Windfall that I’ve been dying to try out (oh, that’s darkly ironic if you know the lore). Ox of Agonas is similar to redemption, just stapled to a body that can recur itself to provide extra gas late-game if we don’t have an Offspring’s Revenge . And you know what they say, you mess with the ox-spring, you get the flaming horns. And that’s pretty much the first version of this deck! Play card-draw spells to fill our yard and find revenges while stalling. Deal incidental damage with our smaller creatures until our more impactful ones touch down or their babies come for revenge. I’ve added some sweepers to ensure we don’t get totally run over with awkward draws. Some potential inclusions that caught my eye while building were Lotleth Giant , Angelic Guardian , and Underworld Sentinel . These can obviously be tweaked a bit depending on playstyle and this deck could probably use a bit more recursion, maybe something like a Corpse Churn just to provide more longevity. The build also doesn’t particularly like graveyard hate, but I haven’t seen Ashiok, Dream Render in a while and General Kudro of Drannith doesn’t seem to be seeing much play. The only drink that can pair perfectly with this manifestation of revenge is something that has aged just as finely. I recommend a barrel-aged beer such as Founders’ Dirty Bastard, a scotch style ale. Vroom Vroom, the Revengine Comes Enchantments 4x Offspring&#39;s Revenge Creatures 4x Basilica Bell-Haunt 2x Cavalier of Dawn 3x Cavalier of Night 4x Drakuseth, Maw of Flames 4x Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger 2x Ox of Agonas 3x Plaguecrafter Instants 2x Heartwarming Redemption 3x Thrill of Possibility Sorceries 4x Cathartic Reunion 3x Shatter the Sky Lands 4x Blood Crypt 4x Fabled Passage 4x Godless Shrine 3x Mountain 1x Plains 4x Sacred Foundry 3x Swamp All Black E’rythang Mono-Black has been a fairly powerful deck over the past few standard formats undergoing various transformations, but it’s recently fallen to the wayside. I think a little splash of blood and thunder is exactly what the deck needs to come back with a vengeance. Mono-Black is not a complicated deck. It wants to curve out; one-drop, two-drop, red-fish, blue-fish, Gray Merchant of Asphodel . My personal favorite sequence is Knight of the Ebon Legion , Yarok’s Fenlurker , Ayara, First of Locthwain , Nightmare Shepherd , and then of course… Gary. Gary is often the final nail in the coffin for opposing decks and mono-black likes to leverage him as much as possible. With the release of Theros Beyond Death, Nightmare shepherd was immediately slotted in to get additional Gary triggers. And now with Ikoria, we get Nightmare Shepherd copies five through eight with lots of upside in Offspring’s Revenge . Revenge give this linear deck options. Things are never truly dead and everything serves double duty. We’re running Cauldron Familiar / Witch’s Oven , because why not, and also Woe Strider . Both sac outlets just fuel our revenge when we need a boost. Besides getting a mini Gary to drain for a million, my personal favorite interaction is with Ayara, First of Locthwain . Every turn with offspring’s revenge out is a drain for one, a free block, and an extra card drawn. This deck’s shell is already pretty set, so after adding Offspring’s Revenge , the only real flex slots I had I gave to Lurrus of the Dream-Den because he gives us even more redundancy and he’s so prominent in every format nowadays. If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Some other potential choices are Rankle, Master of Pranks , Tymaret, Chosen From Death , or removal a la Murderous Rider . I recommend pairing something dark to drink with this deck. An Imperial stout such as Victory’s Storm King has a hefty weight to it and will warm up your icy soul. Or you could take a page out of our Queen Ayara’s playbook and settle with a dark, dry, red wine… or is that blood? Uh … n-nevermind. Not Even Light Can Escape the Blackhole of My Revenge Creatures 4x Ayara, First of Locthwain 4x Cauldron Familiar 4x Gray Merchant of Asphodel 4x Knight of the Ebon Legion 2x Lurrus of the Dream-Den 4x Nightmare Shepherd 4x Woe Strider 4x Yarok&#39;s Fenlurker Artifacts 4x Witch&#39;s Oven Enchantments 4x Offspring&#39;s Revenge Lands 4x Blood Crypt 4x Godless Shrine 10x Swamp 2x Temple of Malice 2x Temple of Silence 50 Shades of Revenge Standard right now is an absolute wonderland when it comes to mana. We have ridiculous color pair support from Return to Return to Ravnica block, complimented by the full set of temples finished in Theros Beyond Death. And we also have shard support and the triomes from Ikoria. Even Throne of Eldraine gave us a crucial mana fixer in Fabled Passage ! So, when the world is our oyster, why would we limit our revenge to merely three colors? Yes. I’m talking a full rainbow of revenge. As I mentioned earlier in the article, when I was researching for this article, I looked at any creature that we could recur, so any creature that has red, white, or black in it, but including any of the other colors. There are a lot of interesting and powerful creatures once you open up your color combos, and since I want to play all of them, this deck has a toolbox sensibility. We’re even using Yorion, Sky Nomad as our companion for value and as an excuse to run even more spice. It also means the mana is ridiculous, but we’ll take it for the few times we really go off. You probably get the gist of what’s up regarding Offspring’s Revenge by now, so I’ll just give you the decklist and you can see this monstrosity unfold for yourself. Also, drink whatever you want with this one, all rules and allegiances have been thrown out the window. Please forgive me for my sins. Vengeance in Technicolor Companion Yorion, Sky Nomad Creatures 3x Atris, Oracle of Half-Truths 2x Deputy of Detention 1x Drakuseth, Maw of Flames 4x Dream Trawler 3x Elite Guardmage 1x God-Eternal Bontu 2x Golgari Findbroker 4x Gravebreaker Lamia 1x Ilharg, the Raze-Boar 2x Knight of Autumn 2x Massacre Girl 2x Polukranos, Unchained 2x Rakdos, the Showstopper Instants 3x Thirst for Meaning Lands 4x Blood Crypt 2x Fabled Passage 4x Godless Shrine 2x Hallowed Fountain 4x Indatha Triome 1x Island 3x Ketria Triome 1x Mountain 1x Plains 4x Raugrin Triome 4x Savai Triome 1x Steam Vents 1x Swamp Enchantments 4x Fires of Invention 4x Offspring&#39;s Revenge Sorceries 4x Cathartic Reunion 2x Idyllic Tutor 3x Shatter the Sky That’s all for now folks! I had stupid amounts of fun brewing these deck and I think we’re only scratching the surface on Offspring’s Revenge ! During the brewing process I had ideas for a mono-red deck with a goblin theme, think Krenko, Tinstreet Kingpin , Goblin Ringleader , etc. or a Boros deck utilizing the life gain cores of past Standards ( Alseid of Life’s Bounty , Ajani’s Pridemate , Linden, the Steadfast Queen ) with beaters like Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice . Okay, I need to stop, y’all already got three lists in this article. But that’s the greatness of finding a sweet card to brew around; the possibilities are endless, but you want to find them all.! So, until next week, kick back, pop a cold one, and stay brewing y’all!

Prooooobably better known as…Chev. Anyway, welcome to the first ever Brawl Homebrew at Hexdrinkers! The focus here will not be on top tier Brawl decks. Right now the meta is choc full of degenerates running &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/war/208/niv-mizzet-reborn?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/5/6/56a2609d-b535-400b-81d9-72989a33c70f.jpg?1582037402&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Niv-Mizzet Reborn &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/iko/192/kinnan-bonder-prodigy?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/6/3/63cda4a0-0dff-4edb-ae67-a2b7e2971350.jpg?1586439211&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy &lt;/a&gt;, decks that are quite linear in design and absolutely bonkers in execution… &lt;strong&gt;Editor’s note: Chev is one of those degenerates. Don’t let him fool you&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of those we’re going to focus on brews that are relatively easy to put together with either some time in standard or a fair number of drafts under your belt. Let’s get right into it!&lt;/p&gt; Belle of the Brawl Today we’re going to start by going back in time three months. Before companions ruled the Earth…before Godzilla became an actual card. Before…Corona (and not the beer). It was a simpler time, my friend Oakley and I were getting our butts handed to us by a father and his nine year old son in a 2HG prerelease. (Actually come to think of it, I feel like a lot of my Brawl memories come from being trounced at prereleases…) Anyway the event was a bust, but I had opened a Siona, Captain of the Pyleas and had started imagining what a Selesnya commander deck would look like with her at the helm, leading an army of heavily auraed forces to victory against legions of foes. Pretty neat right? Not only are you getting value as soon as Siona hits the battlefield, being able to “tutor” for a useful aura but also enabling a token sub strategy is not a bad plan B. The cost of throwing an Intangible Virtue or an Anointed Procession into a 99-card deck isn’t too high and considering they’d also enable more enchantment shenanigans…anyway. Right now you’re probably thinking “Chev, come on. Everyone does commander deck techs. Give me that good good BRAWWWL!” And I’d say, “Hold on, eager reader, we’re getting there.” So I started scheming, and a plan started to form…way too quickly. You see, I couldn’t get my mind out of this rut that after needing to throw in the package of the most powerful auras ( Eldrazi Conscription , Darksteel Mutation , Gift of Immortality ), and the ramp package to be able to play the bigger auras and the consistency of a turn-two Siona… I found much less room for creativity than I would have liked. Some of this could be an amount of creative burnout being fresh off a stint of upgrading most of my other commander decks - maybe Siona was just schemed at the wrong time - but it gave me the glimmer of an idea that you’re about to see the results of. What about putting together a Selesnya aura brawl deck? The restricted cardpool could really be a boon to the creativity required, and enable us to have a more unique experience with oh captain our captain. Enough talk though, let’s tech. Offensive Line We’ve got a pretty impressive lineup available thanks to Theros’s heavy enchantment theme, and a couple powerful standouts from Ikoria and Eldraine. Let’s see the heaviest hitters: All that Glitters reminds me of my only foray into pauper using a build that centered around Slippery Bogle and Ethereal Armor . Unfortunately, trading first strike for growing off of artifacts is not really helpful for us here but being able to directly benefit from every aura and other enchantment we play is reason enough to include this. With any luck, the high number of other auras and enchantment creatures will let this serve as a cheaper copy of our next highlight… Colossification I mean damn, there’s not really much to be said for an aura that hands out +20/+20 besides I hope we can get it on something with trample. It’ll be interesting to see how often this is actually allowed to come down or put in work since the rest of our curve is relatively low. But in the event of a long game, having this big a finisher in your corner ain’t bad. Hydra’s Growth trades Colossification’s significant mana cost for a time investment, being able to easily reach and surpass +20/+20 in the more durable form of +1/+1 counters, but taking a few turns to get there. Hydra’s growth has been an absolute powerhouse in every limited deck I made during the THB season and it’ll be interesting to see how this shapes up in Brawl. I personally think it’ll become a kill on-sight card which is certainly nice to draw attention if we’ve got anything else we need a distraction from. Warbriar Blessing is one of our few forms of removal. White certainly doesn’t have the suite of cheap removal available to it in eternal formats, and besides a couple higher cost instants this might be one of the best chances to stay on theme and pop one of our opponent’s creatures. We’ll see if the benefits outweigh the costs though… But of course, what good are all-star auras without all-star targets to enchant? We need a strong creature base to support our theme and I think these guys have what it takes to go pro: Archon of Sun’s Grace could stand on its own as a 3/4 flyer with lifelink for 4 as a potential target to drop a Colossification on, but add on the Constellation trigger to create MORE flyers with lifelink? What?! It’s like…that’s our strategy or something! Anyway you’ll never be disappointed by drawing this card, at any point in the game. Paradise Druid is a great example of what I consider a long-term investment. Upfront, it can give you a lil mana, get you dropping threats early, but later….you’ve got a creature with conditional hexproof. While you still need to navigate around its loss of hexproof on tap, there’s a lot to be said for equipping Paradise Druid with Sentinel’s Eyes and any other enchantment in your deck to build your own hexproof threat. Just be careful and remember Colossification taps your creature, which would render Paradise Druid vulnerable for a turn. Lavabrink Venturer takes what makes Paradise Druid good and turns it to 11… conditionally. Remember that Protection also protects Lavabrink from your stuff so be incredibly careful about choosing Odd, since that’ll prevent it from being a target of either Colossification, Hydra’s Growth, or Sentinel’s Eyes. Just something to consider. Either way, still incredibly powerful if you have the wildcard to spend. Setessan Champion is what I’d call an undeniable team player. Regardless of who gets the aura you’re playing, Setessan Champion still gets a +1/+1 counter AND draws you a card. That’s some incredible value on a 3-drop, especially considering they’ll also trigger on any enchantment creature or other enchantment you’re playing. Green and White are not known for their card draw, so a repeatable draw engine that also plays along with our deck theme is something I’d even consider in a Siona commander build. Defense As much as I’d love to wage an all-out assault of auras, we do need to be prepared for the inevitable: our opponent will want to play creatures and stuff as much as we do. This is where the second type of aura in our deck comes in. Trapped in the Tower, while conditional, is really worth the two mana. It won’t be able to hit any form of Niv-Mizzet, but clamping down on an indestructible God or any other beast without wings is of incredible benefit. It also has the clause negating activated abilities which puts this over Pacifism in my book. Kenrith’s Transformation is the latest in a long line of such transformations that I had thought were supposed to be in Blue’s part of the color pie. It’s not as powerful as Song of the Dryads or Imprisoned in the Moon , but is still incredibly useful at stopping a threat. It even replaces itself! While testing the deck I did manage to cast this on Kenrith himself, so, that was a huge flavor win. Heliod’s Punishment sneaks in over Dreadful Apathy for a similar reason of Trapped in the Tower over pacifism: the stifling of annoying abilities. Does it have a four turn clock? Sure, but hopefully you’ll get something else by then. While Dreadful Apathy can deal with the threat more permanently at six mana, I’ll gladly take this trade. Especially when targeting a commander who they’d potentially be able to replay if it weren’t stuck on the battlefield. Non-Aura Removal We have several powerful reasons to utilize auras (mainly Siona), but sometimes we need to rid ourselves of a threat more permanently. That’s when we bring in the closers. Banishing Light is incredibly potent and the effect of triggering all the Constellation abilities as well as boosting All that glitters makes this a no brainer. For when trapping Chulane, teller of tales in a tower isn’t enough, try banishing it to the shadow realm. Calix, Destiny’s Hand works as a great enchantment engine, serving as a relatively repeatable mini Siona trigger. This is mostly upside though as his inclusion is frankly due to the power of his minus. Being able to repeatedly Oblivion Ring is no small feat, and having a second copy of Banishing light really helps with consistency. Also, if you’re playing any of the Theros Gods - putting a card underneath Heliod, Sun-Crowned is nigh unbreakable…unless you’re that one jerk I found running Barrier Breach . Swallow Whole might be the closest we get to a straight up Swords to Plowshares in Standard and I believe it should be recognized as such. There are hoops to go through, and it won’t be able to kill everything but having that ability at one mana and a creature will come in handy more often than not. Going Tall and Wide While we don’t plan to spend too much energy on Siona’s secondary ability, I do believe a few cards make their inclusion well justified, and help serve as a potential backup plan when all else fails. Commanding Presence doubles as a pretty powerful aura granting a boost and first strike, this can easily make a dent in defenses, but really shines when paired with the next highlighted card. Divine Visitation is one powerful card. Not only could you be getting an angel for every aura you play with Siona on the field, but even if they’re removed you still reap the benefits from both Commanding Presence, and the previously mentioned Archon of Sun’s Grace . Plenty of opportunities to fill the board with 4/4 angels by doing what you already planned on doing. Everything else included serves mostly to support these bigger themes or protect our investments. Things like Veil of Summer and Unbreakable Formation keep our creatures alive, while Starfield Mystic and Transcendent Envoy make our enchantments cheaper. There are also a couple more high power creatures like Questing Beast but these can really be substituted with whatever bonkers aura-targets you have lying around in a pinch. Here’s the final list! Siona, Captain of the Pyleas Auras Creatures 1x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 1x Archon of Sun&#39;s Grace 1x Destiny Spinner 1x Faeburrow Elder 1x Gilded Goose 1x Heliod, Sun-Crowned 1x Ilysian Caryatid 1x Knight of Autumn 1x Lavabrink Venturer 1x Luminous Broodmoth 1x Paradise Druid 1x Questing Beast 1x Setessan Champion 1x Starfield Mystic 1x Transcendent Envoy Lands 1x Blossoming Sands 1x Command Tower 1x Fabled Passage 9x Forest 9x Plains 1x Temple Garden 1x Temple of Plenty Enchantments 1x All that Glitters 1x Angelic Gift 1x Banishing Light 1x Colossification 1x Commanding Presence 1x Divine Visitation 1x Elspeth Conquers Death 1x Heliod&#39;s Punishment 1x Hydra&#39;s Growth 1x Kenrith&#39;s Transformation 1x New Horizons 1x Omen of the Hunt 1x Sentinel&#39;s Eyes 1x Trapped in the Tower 1x Warbriar Blessing 1x Wolfwillow Haven Instants 1x Karametra&#39;s Blessing 1x Unbreakable Formation 1x Veil of Summer Sorceries 1x Swallow Whole Planeswalkers 1x Calix, Destiny&#39;s Hand Results Out of the 7 matches we played with Siona, we went 5 and 2. Siona was able to successfully ramp and limit the threat of Niv Mizzet, Reborn and Kenrith, the Returned King quite easily with those defensive enchantments while also turning Paradise Druid into an absolute wrecking ball of All that Glitters and Sentinel’s Eyes in both games!! Others against Brokkos, Apex of Forever , Niv-Mizzet, Parun , and Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath followed similar trajectories being able to render an entire stack of mutated creatures inert while Brokkos was in the pile, or keeping Niv-MIzzet stuck to pinging as opposed to also being a flying 6/6. The two games lost partly involved Dreadful Apathy in place of Heliod’s Punishment . In the earlier build of this deck, I favored the more costly total removal over simply rendering a commander unuseable which proved useless against Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy . The second game we just got beat, the Winota, Joiner of Forces deck we were up against played fast and hard - in fact the player was so confident in their ability, they said good game as soon as they played Winota. What a champ. Overall, I think the deck has a lot of potential and is definitely something to play if you’re looking for a unique Brawl experience in the current meta. For a total of 12 Rares and 5 Mythics, you’re looking at a pretty consistent construction. Comparatively, That would get you half a manabase and one set of Uros in Standard! (also 2 of those rares are for Faeburrow Elder and Gilded Goose which could easily be swapped with Incubation Druid and Leafkin Druid if you’re on a budget) Enter The Guildhall &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Siona and the Argonauts (Brawl)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/05/14/brawldt_1.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;titan&#39;s nest (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/rev%20your%20engines/2020/05/11/rye_1.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/7/5/75d4e6f3-73cb-4799-bcb9-c1f5bc234a02.jpg?1586521298&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Titan&#39;s Nest (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every set Wizards teases us with these niche, often rare or mythic, enchantments, that just scream to be built around. These cards can be the core engines of decks that rack up mana and card advantage turn after turn to bury the opponent and allow for explosive kill turns…. or, often, they fall overlooked, misunderstood, and forgotten, unable to compete with the raw efficiency of modern card design.&lt;/p&gt; In Standard, you can look to Wilderness Reclamation and Fires of Invention (two of the best decks currently), but several other enchantments lay in wait in standard that haven’t quite seen their day. Cards like Underworld Breach and Doom Foretold had brief stints in the limelight, but gems like Firemind’s Research , Enigmatic Incarnation , or Happily Ever After (a man can dream, okay?) have seen love only on the fringes, if at all. Ikoria is no different, with a bevy of incredibly spicy and seemingly powerful enchantments. The ones I’m eyeing currently are the rare shard enchantments and we’re kicking off this series with a real doozey in Titan&#39;s Nest ! Welcome to Rev Your Engines, the series where we utilize unique engine enchantments to kick standard into high gear! Will we have a highly tuned engine to take us across the finish line or will we sputter and stall out? (I simultaneously hated and loved making those puns) A Wretched Hive of Scum and Villiany With the right build, Titan’s Nest falls firmly in the “busted” category and I think it could be a major player in standard once rotation comes in the fall. Just reading the card, we essentially give all our spells delve (a mechanic that has gotten cards banned in many formats). Yes, there are some restrictions, no X-spells, only mono-colored spells, but Hydroid Krasis and Expansion//Explosion are too mainstream anyway. Titan’s Nest is also full on Sultai (hooray for the return of wedge support), colors that happen to love putting milling themselves for all sorts of benefit. On the surface, this enchantment can turn our graveyard into a source of ramp to keep our foot on the gas in the mid to late game. But that’s boring. Like I said earlier, this enchantment should not be treated as a fair card, and I intend to use it solely for the forces of evil. And the dastardly villain who has made the Titan’s Nest his lair is none other than Syr Konrad, the Grim . We’re Dealing With a Real Maniac… Syr Konrad was a powerhouse in Throne of Eldraine limited, but in constructed formats he’s been generally overlooked. Some of that might be because he has more lines of text than War and Peace… or more likely because he was turned into an elk. TLDR, any time creatures are entering or leaving the graveyard, Syr Konrad is gonna ping our opponent. They want to wrath, they&#39;ll take a bunch of damage. They mill some of our beloved troops, they get pinged a few times. If creatures are banished to the shadow realm (whoops wrong card game) by Titan’s Nest to generate loads of colorless mana…. they take damage for Every. Single. One. That is our dastardly scheme in a nutshell: mill as much of our deck as possible, get a Syr Konrad and Titan’s Nest on the field and huck a putrid fireball from beyond the grave. Bring in the Minions So, what poor saps have been enlisted as Konrad’s minions to be sent to their inevitable unceremonious demise? Syr Konrad doesn’t discriminate. Merfolk, Bird, Gorgon… Wall? He’ll take every helping hand/fin/brick he can get. The common thread among this creature suite is that all these creatures mill us, fueling our Nest and triggering Konrad if he’s out. We’re looking at three to four cards binned per creature we play which adds up very quickly. While there are cards that could self-mill more efficiently in standard, we need a high density of creatures to enact our combo kill. These creatures all come with upside in that they pad our life total or block incredibly well. Gorging Vulture and Mire Triton both boost our life enough to get us that extra turn we need to assemble our combo. Venomous Hierophant and Mire Triton both have deathtouch which is a big deterrent, especially for larger creatures that will outclass our motley crew of recruits. Wall of Lost Thoughts and Merfolk Secretkeeper have big butts to hold back small creatures chipping in, and Glowspore Shaman often trades up. Also, we are not afraid to chump block or take an early trade! It only fuels us once it comes time to go off. Every Super Villian Needs Some Villianous Tools Our non-creature suite is trim, but supports and adds consistency to our gameplan. I like Tamiyo, Collector of Tales a lot. It’s a versatile card, especially with graveyard strategies. It can dig for our combo pieces, milling us more in the process, or regrow things that we milled earlier. We don’t want to dilute our creature count and at four mana, it’s on the higher end of our curve, but I thought trying one out could be interesting. Corpse churn , an Ikoria reprint, is an auto-include. It mills us and can grab a Syr Konrad we milled or just any other fallen soldier to keep the mill train rolling. Once again, this consistency and ability to maintain momentum is important for a combo deck like ours. The Binding of the Titans was a card that intrigued me at release, but never really found a home in any of my decks until now. Given, it takes some turns, but this card is a powerhouse for us. It mills us, it gains life and allows us to pick off a lurking Uro, Titan of Nature&#39;s Wrath or Lurrus of the Dream-Den target. Nice. In chapter three we even get to fix our mana or, like Corpse Churn, get back a creature we may need or our fearless leader, Syr Konrad. And then after all that, we can exile the Binding to our Titan’s Nest to play our other spells. Tymaret Calls the Dead as a one-of is just a catch-all slot. It mills more than our other cards, albeit over multiple turns, gains us some life at the end, and if you can exile an already spent Binding, we can get an additional blocker (or attacker if our opponent is playing a creature-light deck). The mana base is mostly basics, just to keep it simple. We want to be going as fast as possible, we cannot wait for tap lands. Add a few shocks and Fabled Passage s to fix and season to taste. The Scheme is Foolproof! The plan is simple, mill yourself as fast possible. Use as much or all of your mana every turn and get those cards in your graveyard. Always keep a track of how many creatures are in there so you know when you’ve reached critical mass. Also, keep track of where your Konrads and Nests are. We need those to win the game, so if you get a chance to nab one back from the yard, get it. As you’re playing your creatures out, block aggressively. We want to conserve our life total as best we can, and we lose nothing from an additional creature in the bin. Also, don’t be afraid to attack! Getting chip-ins is critical to lessening the threshold needed for Konrad to do his thing. Most of our creatures attack well, so get in there if it’s free. Unfortunately, this deck comes with some drawbacks, so let’s discuss what might endanger our victory. Like most combo decks, this deck is incredibly linear and there’s no real interaction for us besides blocking, so a counterspell can hinder us. Also, any sort of exile really hurts. Elspeth Conquers Death hits both our main pieces and something like Elspeth’s Nightmare is a nightmare for us as well wiping out all the progress we’ve made. Sometimes we just won’t draw Titan’s Nest and Syr Konrad, or we’ll mill them. Lastly, we realistically can’t deal much more than twenty damage, so any deck that has lots of life gain can be a problem. But these are issues that plague all but the most resilient of combo decks and they’re risks that we’ll take to play this ridiculous yet beautiful brew. On the flip-side, this deck is not a tier deck. Opponents won’t see their demise coming until it’s too late. And since our pseudo delve is a mana ability, they can’t stop it and we can do everything immediately at instant speed! There’s nothing like stacking up 20 Syr Konrad triggers up and letting them machine-gun down our bewildered opponent. If you ever go to play this deck yourself, I recommend cracking open a nice sour beer. Konrad is truly EVIL (&quot;Every Villian is Lemons&quot;) plotting in the Titan&#39;s Nest, and lemons are quite sour. Two of my favorites are Druthers&#39; Dare and Dogfish Head&#39;s Seaquench.

Countless outlets exist to get every type of Magic fix available. MTGGoldfish, MTGStocks, TCGPlayer, Scryfall, CoolStuffInc, and Hipsters of the Coast all provide great content. We enjoy serving up competitive analysis and meta discussion, but we also want to provide a window into how we experience magic and how it has been an outlet of creativity for us. We found that magic is not only a game, but a way to communicate. It could be explaining your incredibly convoluted and “totally tier 1” combo you assembled to your friends around the kitchen table, or just discussing all the hot spoilers that’ll slot into your commander decks around the campfire. These holistic experiences that most people would tell you are their favorite memories of the game should be shared with joy: and we want to bring that to all of you. Best Commanders to play during a night of drinking? How is crafting a deck like making Homebrew? Which of our decks have aged like fine wines and which went down the hatch quick like a shot of bottom tier vodka. Every game and every card has its own story. We’d love for you to join us in recanting this all. Grab a drink and shuffle up! Meet our Founders: Chev Eldrid - Having just completed a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Chev is eager to develop his skills in both software development and Magic content creation. He’ll be bringing you content on Brawl, Commander, and some streaming in the upcoming weeks with a couple series soon to be announced. Chev is probably also responsible for anything broken on the site so he’s the person to contact for that. Julian Leal - A recent graduate of the University of Maryland, Julian has spent the last year developing his professional career as a Geologist. Though he’s most at home playing Commander, Julian has also spent this time striving to branch into all other constructed formats and brewing around anything and everything. Expect brews and competitive decks in Standard, a delve into Historic, and the occasional foray into limited (plus whatever other debauchery he can sneak past Chev). Julian will also be streaming, hopefully regularly. Thanks for stopping by! I know we look small now but I promise, we’re just getting started.

For those of you just joining me, welcome! Check out part 1 of this analysis where I cover aggro and tribal decks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexdrinkers.com/historically%20speaking/2020/09/09/historic2-1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Same as before, I’ve broken down the decks under these broader archetypes. I’ll only be covering the most prominent decks in the meta, we’ll save the brewing for later wink wink. So without further adieu, let’s finish our grand tour! “Midrange” Decks Midrange is a contentious term nowadays, with recent pushes in power seemingly squeezing it out of most formats, especially recent Standards. However, I’m using it to refer to decks that don’t go as low and fast as the aggro (or tribal) decks and are more proactive than the control decks we’ll discuss later. Golgari Sacrifice Artifacts 4x Bolas&#39;s Citadel Creatures 4x Blood Artist 3x Gilded Goose 2x Jadelight Ranger 4x Llanowar Elves 3x Llanowar Visionary 2x Paradise Druid 4x Priest of Forgotten Gods 2x Scavenging Ooze 4x Woe Strider Enchantments 2x Bastion of Remembrance Instants 4x Collected Company Lands 6x Forest 4x Overgrown Tomb 2x Phyrexian Tower 6x Swamp 4x Woodland Cemetery This deck represents a few different strands of a powerful sacrifice core. Tied together with Collected Company it often grinds value until it can pull off a pseudo-combo kill with Bolas’s Citadel . In general they’re Golgari, though some versions move towards Abzan, some towards Jund. Don’t worry if this sounds like a lot, we’ll go into the unique flavors of this build a little later but for right now let’s talk about the foundation they all have in common. The sacrifice core of this deck features the likes of Woe Strider , Priest of Forgotten Gods , and Blood Artist , among others. In their purest essence, these decks want to churn through their libraries using sacrifice value and eventually drain their opponents out with a Blood Artist effect. Woe Strider is another integral piece, providing a free sacrifice outlet which is absolutely key, giving you a goat to get the engines started, and can recur itself if you run out of gas. It also allows you to scry with each sacrifice as well which keeps the gas rolling, especially for Bolas’s Citadel , more on that later. Oh, also, Phyrexian Tower is a powerful Magic Card. The other all star of this deck is Priest of Forgotten Gods . It’s key in removing opposing creatures, especially something out of the Auras deck, or a lone Muxus, Goblin Grandee with the trigger on the stack. If you can get a Priest and some fodder out early, you can often keep your opponent off creatures for several turns, giving you the time you need to assemble your engine or just beat down. Lastly, the Priest draws (always good) and that double black mana boost can help on key multi-spell turns or for powering out a Citadel. Along with these sacrifice-based cards, the deck plays a whole suite of mana dorks like Llanowar Elves , Gilded Goose , and Llanowar Visionary . These ramp/fix you and also are prime sacrifice fodder when you need to get down to brass tacks. They tend to be unsatisfactory hits off Collected Company , but they’re a necessary evil and two mediocre hits are better than no hits. Finally, let’s discuss the hulking monstrosity in the room… Bolas’s Citadel . Much like Muxus, Goblin Grandee in Goblins, Citadel is the “I Win” card in Golgari Sac. With the draining effects of something like Blood Artist and low average CMC, you can tear through the top of your deck with little concern for your life, scrying away lands with Woe Strider . Dump enough creatures onto the board and sacrifice them for a machine gun effect to decimate your opponent’s life total. Sometimes you won’t be able to pull off the full combo and close out the game, but you’ll often be able to establish a healthy board presence and set up for a kill next turn. Variations on a (Sacrificial) Theme Now that we’ve discussed the basics of the deck, let’s hit on the different flavors real quick. Golgari is of course the most straightforward. They get to run all the dorks, a full four-of Bolas’s Citadel , and Bastion of Remembrance alongside Blood Artist for drain. They also get some flex slots where you might put a Jadelight Ranger or Nightmare Shepherd . This version is clean and tuned. It won’t have mana problems and it wants to bust out a Citadel as soon as possible to go off. Simple and effective, but its Company hits are the weakest on average and most importantly it isn’t … flashy. Jund versions of this deck trim their Citadels and often forego Blood Artist entirely to form a shell much akin to the Jund Food deck of recent Standards (a personal favorite deck of mine, check out this gameplay). Mayhem Devil is an A+ card in a shell such as this being able to remove blockers, clear fodder for a Priest of Forgotten Gods activation, or of course just pinging face. Alongside the Devil is good old Cat / Oven to make sure you’re maximizing that damage. I’ve seen lists run Bonecrusher Giant for value and Claim the Firstborn depending on how disruptive they want to be, but Mayhem Devil is one hundred percent worth the splash. Lastly, there are Abzan versions. These are probably my least favorite as they don’t gain enough for the mana inconsistency. The only white inclusions (at least in the main deck) is Cruel Celebrant , which is an excellent Blood Artist replacement or supplement, but doesn’t have the versatility that Mayhem Devil does. This deck is one of the most versatile in the meta and can take several different lines depending on the opponent. However, similar to Elves from pt 1, it can falter when you draw the wrong half of your deck. All mana dorks does you no good, and only having your payoffs won’t let you establish your engine as you’re sacrificing everything. Also, the “randomness” of your most powerful engines, Collected Company and Bolas’s Citadel can cause you to miss or stall out and that can often prove fatal. Too many times I’ve gotten my opponent down to two or three life and then hit double lands off the top with Citadel. Just as many times, I’ve needed a reasonable Company to retake board dominance and fuel a Priest, and I hit… a single measly Llanowar Elves . Feels bad man. And of course, any quick deck with good spot-removal can take out your key pieces (Strider, Priest, Devil) as you’re setting up and totally halt any progress. That being said, the raw power of your pieces and the adaptability of the deck will truly reward dedicated and detail-oriented play. Gruul Artifacts 2x Embercleave Creatures 4x Bonecrusher Giant 2x Earthshaker Khenra 4x Gruul Spellbreaker 1x Klothys, God of Destiny 4x Llanowar Elves 4x Lovestruck Beast 2x Pelt Collector 1x Rhonas the Indomitable 4x Robber of the Rich 4x Scavenging Ooze Instants 4x Collected Company Sorceries 2x Primal Might Lands 8x Forest 5x Mountain 4x Rootbound Crag 1x Sheltered Thicket 4x Stomping Ground Much less complicated than the previous set of decks, Gruul probably shouldn’t even be considered a midrange deck. A statement to how powerful aggro is in this format, Gruul is merely a midrange deck because it goes bigger and is a bit more resilient than your typical aggro deck. Shockingly similar to Gruul aggro/midrange in Standard (did you know they printed powerful cards this last year?) it often curves Pelt Collector into Robber of the Rich into Lovestruck Beast into Questing Beast , often with an Embercleave not far behind. Fat and hasty threats are the name of the game. Most of these cards don’t need any explaining, they’re just big and good at attacking. I will break down some of the more important ones though: Questing Beast continues to be a thorn in many players’ side, just like in Standard, and with the presence of a lot of low to the ground creature decks is usually unblockable. Chipping in for a free four damage a turn with vigilance to wall most things in the format is nasty. Robber of the Rich is a cheap, hasty threat, and since a lot of the interaction in this format is cheap and powerful, he can easily turn an opponent’s Thoughtsieze or Opt against them. Collected Company is back (go figure) and gets the most powerful cards pound for pound in this deck. Bonecrusher Giant , Lovestruck Beast , Gruul Spellbreaker , and Rhonas, the Indomitable all clock in at three mana, but with stats that hit far above that weight class. It’s like when the opposing team’s pitcher in Little League is 6 ft and 200 lbs. Except there’s two of them, they teleport into battle like damn ninja, they may or may not be vicious bestial humanoids, and you aren’t playing baseball. The last card I want to highlight is Primal Might . At worst it’s a one mana fight spell, which since your creatures are all huge, is just a straight up removal spell. But when the game is going long, you can pump up your creature to astronomical heights, remove their best blocker, and go to town. Add in trample from Rhonas, the Indomitable and you just close the game out right there! The biggest thing this deck has going for it is the raw POWER of each of its cards. There isn’t really any synergy, just the most efficient threats, pound for pound. Mana dorks to accelerate you and beaters at every point along the curve keep the pressure on while Collected Company refills you and Embercleave punches through defenses like a gaddang battering ram. You even get a bit of removal with Stomp and Primal Might , plus whatever Robber of the Rich might snag. RG monsters is back and man does it feel good. Control Decks Lastly, but not leastly, ye olde control decks. My personal favorite archetype, I was disappointed with control’s place in the meta. With the prominence of aggro decks and midrange decks that could be considered aggro decks, it’s hard for control to maintain a home, and of those I’ll mention, I’d really only consider one a true control deck. Sultai Ramp Creatures 4x Hydroid Krasis 4x Uro, Titan of Nature&#39;s Wrath Instants 2x Aether Gust 3x Eliminate 4x Growth Spiral 2x Heartless Act 1x Pact of Negation Sorceries 2x Extinction Event 1x Languish 1x Maelstrom Pulse 4x Thoughtseize Planeswalkers 4x Nissa, Who Shakes the World 1x Vraska, Golgari Queen Lands 4x Breeding Pool 1x Castle Locthwain 3x Drowned Catacomb 3x Fabled Passage 1x Fetid Pools 2x Forest 1x Hinterland Harbor 2x Island 4x Overgrown Tomb 2x Swamp 4x Zagoth Triome First, Sultai. I honestly hate this deck. It’s incredibly close to the Sultai of Standard that’s been dominant in some variation for nearly a year. You play your Growth Spiral s and Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath s, ramp to a Nissa, Who Shakes the World , and then play a humongous Hydroid Krasis to stabilize your life and completely refill your hand. You also get basically all the best interaction in Thoughtseize , Eliminate , and Aether Gust . The thing that I don’t like about this deck is there aren’t really any good play patterns and there isn’t any real decision-making. All your cards are stupidly powerful and can grind your opponent into oblivion. If something gets removed or countered, you already have enough backup to brush it off. Stick one threat and it can easily close the game. The only real decision is the number of Languish s or Extinction Event s you run, which by the way are the best sweepers in the format (and this includes freaking Wrath of God ). The list I’ve posted is generic, but feel free to customize your counterspell and removal suite. As long as you’re running four-ofs of Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath , Nissa, Who Shakes the World , Hydroid Krasis , and Thoughtseize , you pretty much can’t go wrong. I’m done with this deck, let’s move onto something better. Come get me Uro fans. Orzhov Yorion Companion Yorion, Sky Nomad Creatures 4x Burglar Rat 4x Charming Prince 2x Gonti, Lord of Luxury 2x Ravenous Chupacabra Enchantments 4x Demonic Pact 4x Doom Foretold 2x Elspeth Conquers Death 2x Elspeth&#39;s Nightmare 4x Oath of Kaya 1x The Eldest Reborn 4x Treacherous Blessing 3x Trial of Ambition Instants 2x Final Payment 3x Flicker of Fate 2x Mortify Sorceries 4x Thoughtseize Lands 2x Barren Moor 1x Castle Ardenvale 2x Castle Locthwain 4x Godless Shrine 4x Isolated Chapel 7x Plains 2x Secluded Steppe 7x Swamp 4x Temple of Silence A deck I don’t see super often on the ladder, Orzhov Yorion is one of the most interesting decks in the meta. It’s also one of the most fun to pilot and one of the most miserable to play against, but whatever. Functioning around blinking powerful enchantments (and y’all know how much I love enchantments), this deck’s pinnacle is establishing a loop with Yorion, Sky Nomad and Charming Prince . Yorion, Sky Nomad (as a Companion and in the maindeck) provides mass blink to all your hateful pieces. Charming Prince provides a way to rebuy your Yorions and if you can keep them both alive, they cycle in and out in a sort of lock to continually reset all your enchantments. The outcome? Your opponent has no permanents and no cards in hand. Nice. In terms of enchantments, we have all of the best. Elspeth is really coming in swinging between Elspeth Conquers Death and Elspeth’s Nightmare , both very powerful includes. They both do exactly what you want: removal and resource denial, whether that’s cards in hand, cards in graveyard, or taxing the opponent’s mana. Then, as the dust is clearing, you’ll get to reanimate a fallen Yorion to renew your opponent’s subscription to poundtown. Trial of Ambition and The Eldest Reborn provide spicy repeatable options to make your opponent sacrifice, which is key against any decks packing protection. Oath of Kaya provides a repeatable Lightning Helix effect, and while it helps keep our opponent from having permanents (in case you couldn’t tell, that’s the plan), it also goes to the face and can close out games. The two crown jewels of this deck are Doom Foretold and Demonic Pact . Doom Foretold is Trial or Eldest on steroids and won’t stop until your opponent has no permanents and that sacrifice trigger is the final nail in the coffin. Often the best option for an opponent who doesn’t have an abundance of nonland permanents already is to just sandbag and wait for the Foretold to pop, which gives us time to set up even more lock pieces and strip any chance of our opponent from winning, by playing something like a Demonic Pact . Demonic Pact does everything we could ever want. We can pick off creatures, refill our hand, and even more important in this deck, deny our opponents resources. Then before that pesky fourth choice comes around, we just blink it and get back to the sweet, sweet value. Or we cast Final Payment and sacrifice it, another sweet line of tech. Either way, what I’m trying to say is demonic pacts are fun and don’t pose us a liability. Highly recommend. The final part of this deck that I think is great is its customizability. Yes, I love enchantments, and there’s already plenty of great options, but if you want to go for a more creature-centric build you can! Ravenous Chupacabra is a great addition to merk anything and everything while Burglar Rat provides your discard effect. This deck can be slow to start and definitely demands more thought intensive lines of play, but the sheer off-the-wall construction of the deck, getting to play a deck essentially devoid of staples, and the utter domination that comes from pulling out a win with this deck is worth it. Azorius Control Enchantments 3x The Birth of Meletis 1x Cast Out 2x Seal Away 2x Search for Azcanta 3x Shark Typhoon Instants 1x Blink of an Eye 4x Censor 2x Dovin&#39;s Veto 3x Hieroglyphic Illumination 2x Pact of Negation 1x Settle the Wreckage 2x Sphinx&#39;s Revelation Planeswalkers 2x Narset, Parter of Veils 3x Teferi, Hero of Dominaria Sorceries 3x Wrath of God Lands 2x Castle Ardenvale 3x Field of Ruin 4x Glacial Fortress 4x Hallowed Fountain 4x Plains 3x Irrigated Farmland 6x Island Finally, we’ve come to the end. My favorite deck in my favorite archetype. Good ol’ Azorius Draw-Go Control. The only true control deck in this article and pretty much the only tiered control deck in the meta, this harkons to the glory days of the archetype. Rife with counterspells, removal, card advantage, and a noticeable lack of win-conditions, I love this deck. But it isn’t really that good. It’s inherently reactive by nature, counter/remove your opponent’s threats until they don’t have any. Then you can think about slowly winning through something like a Shark Typhoon or Castle Ardenvale . With so much of the meta being hyper-proactive and able to go wayyyy under this deck, testing was rough. The upside is you can answer pretty much anything. Censor and Dovin’s Veto continue to be excellent counter spells with Pact of Negation allowing for you to tap out on crucial turns with back up. Cast Out and Seal Away both exile with the former able to hit problematic permanents. Settle the Wreckage is a great safety valve, especially against something like Goblins and Wrath of God continues to prove why it is the OG. Opponents can’t afford to overcommit to the board against this deck. Azorius Control also packs the best raw card advantage. Hieroglyphic Illumination was an excellent pickup with its ability to scale. Narset, Parter of Veils continues to dig way farther than she should and Search for Azcanta is amazing in the late game when it flips. Lastly, Sphinx’s Revelation is in this deck. I think that’s all I need to say, that card slaps. Finally, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria aka “Scourge of Dominaria Standard” tops off our deck. This is generally our best card and can run away with the game if we stick him. He does basically everything. However, I think the sad truth is that this just isn’t enough anymore. Even with some of the best control cards ever printed, I don’t think trading one for one with the opponent is going to cut it in today’s format. Even with the best sideboard cards in the entire meta, being reactive instead of proactive often can’t compete. I’ll continue to play this deck cause I love it, but I wouldn’t take this to a tournament anytime soon. A Challenger Approaches Well, that concludes the second and final part of this metagame analysis! I hope you enjoyed and learned something so you can go out and crush those queues. Let us know on Twitter or in the comments below which of these decks you’re loving (or hating) and if you’ve found any tweaks that give you the edge in your match-ups.

For the rest, here’s the breakdown!&lt;/p&gt; There’s something wonderful about playing mono-color in commander. Nowadays there are so many “must-play” cards being added to the format (looking at you Arcane Signet ) that it can feel the more colors you play, the less room you have to add your commander’s unique package. Think about the infrastructure required to get a rainbow deck going compared to a color combination that’s less mana-taxing. Monocolor doesn’t exactly get rid of all the required cards, every color has them, but playing with less colors means there are fewer cards you feel compelled to play. Of course there is a downside. Playing with only one color means you really are beholden to the restrictions of that color. Red can’t deal with enchantments, White doesn’t really draw cards, Green has a hard time losing games. Things have to be kept balanced! Joking aside, this week I want to take a look at my FAVORITE monocolor style, ever since I purchased the Sworn to Darkness C14 precon. Mono-black. Welcome back to Homebrewed, it’s been a while. I have to fit article-writing in between relaxing on the beach and enjoying the California sun so it’s been tough you know? Don’t worry, it’ll be worth the wait, I promise. As you might have picked up, The Hexdrinkers have been doing weekly game nights as a way to test out new strategies and build ideas in a real setting while also being able to stay close and of course, play Magic. The past couple weeks I’ve strayed from my typical rotation of Hapatra shenanigans, Eldrazi nonsense, and Coin-Flip insanity to a different deck: Toshiro Umezawa . This incredibly unique commander from Betrayers of Kamigawa (In fact, isn’t he THE Betrayer? I’ll have to check with Eric…) really encourages a unique playstyle for Black. I mean yes it’s wrapped in murdering as many creatures as possible, but you don’t often see Black reanimating anything but creatures. Focusing on instants gets you at LEAST double the murder mayhem. Plus, Black has some real surprise cards that’ll have people scratching their heads as to why they were allowed to exist. You’ll love this deck if: You’re a spellslinger trying to branch out of Izzet You love having answers to your opponents’ nasty creatures 90% of the time You like having multiple play avenues at any given time (Editor’s note: Don’t we all…?) You want to give green ramp a run for its money Maybe this deck isn’t quite for you if: You’re looking to take advantage of Black’s creature suite You want the love and affection of anyone else at the table You prefer a more linear playstyle. Well. Ish. Okay so it’s linear in the “kill a creature, re-cast a kill spell, kill another creature, until the mana runs dry” kinda way. But there’s some surprising versatility there! …Although now I say that out loud it sounds kinda murder-y… Permanents are your friends The best way I have to describe this build is Black Spellslinger. It wouldn’t be wrong to say you’re trying to cast at least one instant per turn once Toshiro hits the board, and squeezing every last trigger out of the recently deceased. Also an advance warning: the first few times you whip this out you WILL misplay. I’m still doing it. There are so many options at any given time that unless you give it your full attention, you’ll be leaving value on the table. And that’s a really good thing!! Honestly, most of my decks run a little on the janky side so having something more interesting is scratching an itch I didn’t know I had! With that - on to the build! Kill la Kill Funnily enough the core of this deck is also the part that’s most ripe for experimentation. Black is obviously rife with creature removal so your options for which pieces to run are almost endless. Here I’ve decided to highlight just a couple of my favorites. But hey! “Y’all do y’all”, as Julian would say. Curtains’ Call is from that Commander 2016 cycle of cards that has Undaunted, aka they cost less for each opponent you have. I don’t think I’ve ever seen any others played outside of Sublime Exhalation but destroying two target creatures for (usually) 3 mana is a steal. This is also your first reminder that any kill spell that pulls double duty results in TWO triggers for Toshiro, so use that as you will. (Fun rules fact: You can target an instant you just cast to destroy a creature with the resulting Toshiro trigger. So something like Malicious Affliction can be cast from your hand to kill one thing, targeted with Toshiro’s ability, and then be cast from the yard to kill two more thanks to Morbid. Food for thought.) Snuff Out along with Slaughter Pact (and to a lesser extent Deadly Rollick - cause it exiles) can be cast for 0 when you need them and boy oh boy, coming across one copy of these can be annoying enough but two?? That’s a potential of six free pieces of targeted removal per game. Drag to the Underworld is nothing special, but due to its recent printing it might not show up as high on usage charts. I’m here on its behalf to remind you that with Toshiro out this will just cost double black and be a very cost efficient removal spell Outside of instants, might I also suggest the following for your death triggers? Turns out Black’s pretty good at wiping things out at sorcery speed too… Boardwipes are a critical part of any EDH build, and here they pull double duty. One-sided wraths like In Garruk’s Wake will clear the way for your army of darkness and give Toshiro a bounty of triggers, while more symmetrical wipes like Damnation will still allow Toshiro to “see” everything else dying which you can utilize for some more instants. What more could you want! Feed the Swarm is Black’s first foray into targeted enchantment removal which has been one of Black’s weaknesses since the beginning so while it can destroy creatures, it’ll probably be used for the other mode more often than not. The Other Spells When you’re not raining hellfire, sometimes you need spells that do OTHER things. I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes you’ll want these even more than kill spells. Succumb to Temptation is one of the only Black draw spells at instant speed outside of Wretched Confluence . Can you believe that?? Either way, I cannot think of a game I haven’t cast this twice and been all the better for it. Withering Boon and Imp’s Mischief fall flatly in the category of “Wait, Black can do that???” An Essence Scatter for an additional 3 measly life? Of course! I’ve found people will expect the Spanish Inquisition more than the mono black player to have a response to their creature. Imp’s Mischief is the same deal; not necessarily a counter, but at least it’ll redirect someone’s malicious intent… or steal a game-winning spell. Either way, use it! Death by 1000 Pings Toshiro gives each creature death fantastic utility - but this is Black! He shouldn’t be the only one out there basking in the misery of others! That’s where the squad comes in. Pick your favorites. I know there will be Blood Artist or Bastion of Remembrance fans out there but for me I’ve gotta go with these guys: Syr Konrad, the Grim and Massacre Wurm have each won me games with this build. Sometimes from wiping out solid boardstates flinging fast and furious instants or a well-timed In Garruk’s Wake , but in every case, the pings really add up. As for Reaper from the Abyss …well taking down an extra creature per turn is icing on an already scrumptious cake. But for what we’re really trying to accomplish, those guys are just the beginning. Let me introduce you to our real game-winners. Literally the dynamic Duo, Revel in Riches has an alternate wincon that is easily achievable in just a couple turns. Even if it gets taken out, odds are you’re up on mana from when you cast it. Black Market is an older flavor, but even more potent in the mana generation department once it really gets a fat stack of counters, something we’re happy to assist and provide. Some games I’ve been able to cast my entire hand without touching my landbase. Big Mana This is a pretty typical package, but for those of you that don’t know, Black can pull off some absolutely heinous stuff when it comes to mana generation. Mostly it’s due to two key cards and their variants: Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth and Cabal Coffers . We run both along with Expedition Map . Basically, with both are on the field all your lands become swamps and then you can just tap two to activate Cabal Coffers to add mana equal to your entire land count to your mana pool. This is, how you say, broken. And your friends will hate it. I’ve also added Coffers’ little brother Cabal Stronghold and Manascape Refractor for redundancy. Most games, you’ll end up with more mana than you know what to do with, which is perfect for a game-winning Torment of Hailfire . Oh and if you’re really feeling it, toss in a Thespian’s Stage or a Magus of the Coffers for good measure. You’ll thank me. Final Shoutouts While most cards fit nicely into boxes, there are a couple I want to give special attention to for their continued support in this deck’s ability to wreck face. Primal Amulet is a fun way to trick opponents into thinking you probably can’t cast anything with the one mana you have open and then BAM! Heartless Act . But what’s even better is when you flip it…Yes, you read Primal Wellspring right. In a deck with such a high instant count this gets exponential quickly as it doubles our Toshiro triggers as well. I quickly realized why there’s been a greater push for land destruction in EDH. Sangromancer brought me back from the brinks of Hell in a couple games. Not only does murdering everything kind of paint a target on your back, but to utilize things like Phyrexian Arena and Necropotence you’re going to be losing a fair bit of life. Given a few turns, Sangromancer can turn all that around. Gravebreaker Lamia is not only Entomb on a stick, but also makes our Toshiro triggers that much more efficient and attainable. Oooo boy. Conclusion And that’s it! A powerful Black commander that can bring the hurt consistently and provide a greater challenge to pilot than what I usually bring to the table. I highly recommend giving Toshiro a look and drawing a few sample hands. You won’t look back… For the full list, pop over here!

History isn’t written overnight and I’ve been taking my time to test many decks from the meta and playing against even more. I came out victorious in many battles, but I also did a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of losing (hence the title, and also cause I wanted to continue the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; references). It wasn’t all for naught though. After all that struggle, I think I’ve finally come up with a comprehensive overview of what’s out there as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each deck.&lt;/p&gt; I’ve broken down the decks under broad archetypes and then will discuss specific decks within and close out with more broad conclusions. But with so much to cover, I think it’s best to just jump right in! Tribal Decks There are three notable tribal decks in the format, uncoincidentally, some that have had the longest and most successful histories in Magic: Goblins, Elves, and Merfolk. All three have a plethora of good creatures to choose from as well as a healthy selection of lords and can be held together by one of the pillars of the format, Collected Company . Merfolk Companion Jegantha, the Wellspring Creatures 4x Benthic Biomancer 4x Deeproot Elite 4x Kumena&#39;s Speaker 4x Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca 4x Merfolk Mistbinder 4x Merrow Reejerey 4x Mist-Cloaked Herald 4x Silvergill Adept Instants 4x Collected Company Lands 4x Breeding Pool 4x Forest 2x Hashep Oasis 4x Hinterland Harbor 8x Island 2x Temple of Mystery Merfolk is arguably the weakest at the moment. It does benefit from access to Collected Company , but it’s still really just a deck from Ixalan Standard, “a notoriously less powerful standard (especially compared to the last year cough cough”). Merfolk Mistbinder and Merrow Reejerey are both high quality lords. Silvergill Adept helps keep a stream of merfolk to play. Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca is a phenomenal payoff as well as a crucial engine to make the deck run. She’s definitely the most powerful card in the deck and luckily with four toughness is harder to kill due to the prevalence of Shock and three-damage burn spells. Deeproot Elite can buff up your merfolk though it takes a bit longer than is acceptable in this format and can get removed quickly. In the early game, Merfolk lack the explosive mana generation of Elves or Goblins to establish a dominating board presence quickly. While they can build up an impressive army and beat out other generic creature deck, any deck that tries to go under then can either push damage quicker or at least take out key pieces before critical mass is achieved. A Thoughtseize or removal spell (of which there are many cheap ones in the format) can tear you apart and set you back a turn or more in the early game, which is a death sentence. Elves Creatures 4x Allosaurus Shepherd 4x Dwynen&#39;s Elite 4x Elvish Archdruid 4x Elvish Clancaller 4x Elvish Visionary 4x Imperious Perfect 4x Llanowar Elves 3x llanowar Visionary 4x Paradise Druid Instants 4x Collected Company Lands 2x Castle Garenbrig 15x Forest 4x Hashep Oasis Elves function on a similar game plan to Merfolk; establish a dominating board presence thanks to a low average CMC and a plethora of lords. Where Elves rises above our fishy friends is in its mana generation. Llanowar Elves , Paradise Druid , and Llanowar Visionary all help your mana explode to deploy your hand at a blistering pace. Elvish Visionary keeps the train rolling, Dwynen’s Elite provides another body, and then there are three phenomenal lords: Elvish Clancaller , Imperious Perfect , and Elvish Archdruid , all with excellent secondary effects. Tying the Elven menace together is Collected Company which can turn your board from unimposing to a major threat in an instant (Editor’s note: …. Was that a pun? 3/10 at best). Elves have the explosivity that Merfolk lacks, and you can even adjust my list to include honorary elf Craterhoof Behemoth (searched up by Fierce Empath ) to really close games with a thunder of footfalls. Where Elves stumbles is when you draw all mana and no gas. A board full of Llanowar elves is nothing if you don’t have an Archdruid or Clancaller to beef them up. Also, of course, a well timed removal spell can turn an alpha strike into a slaughter of your forces. Goblins Creatures 4x Conspicuous Snoop 2x Gempalm Incinerator 4x Goblin Chieftain 4x Goblin Instigator 1x Goblin Ringleader 4x Goblin Warchief 4x Krenko, Mob Boss 4x Muxus, Goblin Grandee 4x Skirk Prospector 4x Wily Goblin Lands 3x Castle Embereth 2x Forgotten Cave 18x Mountain 2x Phyrexian Tower Lastly, we have Goblins, the best tribal deck, and potentially the only “combo deck” in the meta. Goblins only has one true lord, Goblin Chieftain , but their ability to give haste with either Chieftain or Goblin Ringleader more than makes up for that. Goblins can strike out of nowhere, which makes them a big threat. They also have healthy mana generation with Wily Goblin making a treasure, Chieftain reducing all your goblins, and Skirk Prospector being an absolute all-star when it comes to powering out our high end goblins, especially considering how wide Goblins can go (see Krenko, Mob Boss and Goblin Instigator ). Plus Goblins can keep up the card advantage with the new addition of Conspicuous Snoop and veterans Goblin Ringleader or Goblin Matron . But of course, we have to talk about Muxus, Goblin Grandee . Muxus is what puts this deck over the top and why I call it a combo deck. Often, the best thing to be doing is getting Muxus out there as quickly as possible, using Wily Goblin , Goblin Chieftain , and Skirk Prospector ’s insane mana generation (plus Phyrexian Tower at times). A turn three or four Muxus isn’t out of the question and can even be common. And depending on your luck with the trigger, you can easily end the game right there, or at least mortally wound your opponent giving them a single turn to deal with your army. As the deck I played the most, and my favorite during testing, I can say that this deck can live or die by variance. A Muxus flip of only one or two goblins can lose you the game and even if you get a veritable army, no haste can leave you vulnerable to Wrath of God which is running rampant in midrange and control decks. Also, with a six mana Muxus that you’re striving to get to, this deck runs a reasonable number of lands, but that can translate into flood if you get to a quick start and then get wrathed or dismantled which can stagnate and catch you an L. Overall, tribal decks are fun for their explosiveness and the potential to attack with a thick board of pumped up creatures. Also, the ability of all three of these decks (yes I even saw some goblins decks splashing) to play Collected Company is a boon. However, these decks generally lack the interaction to prevent an opponent’s game plan and are very weak to opposing interaction, especially in the early game when attempting to build a board state and a single stumble can crumble your whole plan. Aggro Decks Aggro decks is a wide label, which arguably includes tribal decks, but I’ve identified a few distinct archetypes that stood out: Rakdos Arcanist, Lurrus Auras, and everyone’s favorite… Burn! Lurrus Auras Companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den Creatures 4x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 3x Gingerbrute 4x Kor Spiritdancer 3x Ornithopter 3x Selfless Savior Enchantments 4x All that Glitters 3x Cartouche of Knowledge 3x Cartouche of Solidarity 4x Curious Obsession 4x Staggering Insight Instants 3x Karametra&#39;s Blessing Lands 4x Glacial Fortress 4x Hallowed Fountain 4x Island 8x Plains 2x Temple of Epiphany Lurrus Auras is an Azorius Bogles-esque deck. Boasting a ton of one mana or zero mana creatures (hello Ornithopter ) it can quickly suit up something harmless into an intergalactic menace (“Call Voltron to save us! Wait, our enemy is Voltron? Nooooooooo!”). By far the most important cards in the deck are the Curiosity effects, Curious Obsession and Staggering Insight . Being able to draw with every hit (this deck does not block, that’s for cowards) keeps the advantage snowballing. Stack up multiple of these on an Ornithopter or Gingerbrute and your opponent will be hard pressed to catch up. The cherry on top is Kor Spiritdancer . A veteran from Modern Bogles, she was introduced with Jumpstart and can get oppressively big while continuing to rip through your deck. Playing your final aura onto a Spiritdancer, drawing another aura, rinse and repeat until you run out of mana, is an easy and common line. This deck also plays Lurrus of the Dream-Den because why not, so of course it can grind and return any auras for a second run, just when your opponent thought they’d gotten rid of the pesky things. The weakness of this deck is you can get X-for-one’d if your opponent removes your Megazord, especially if they remove your creature out from under an aura on the stack. Alseid of Life’s Bounty and Karametra’s Blessing provide protection at key chokepoints, especially against decks heavy with removal or if you aren’t off to a blistering start (which can be common). The other weakness of this deck is of course going all in on a creature can make it hard to rebuild. Spiritdancer and the Curiosity effects are crucial for keeping a full grip so you can continue applying pressure. Burn Companion Jegantha, the Wellspring Creatures 4x Earthshaker Khenra 4x Ghitu Lavarunner 2x Grim Lavamancer 3x Rampaging Ferocidon 4x Soul-Scar Mage 4x Viashino Pyromancer Instants 4x Lightning Strike 4x Shock 4x Wizard&#39;s Lightning Sorceries 4x Light Up the Stage 1x Pillar of Flame 2x Skewer the Critics Lands 16x Mountain 4x Ramunap Ruins Burn has been a red mage’s ace in the hole since Lightning Bolt got printed, which if you aren’t an MTG history buff, was in the first dang set. Another deck imported from Modern, Historic Burn is a powerful and wildcard-inexpensive deck (Budget players rejoice!). Burn, like a lot of these decks, wasn’t a viable option until Amonkhet Remastered was released. Ghitu Lavarunner , Viashino Pyromancer , Shock , and Lightning Strike make a nice start for a deck with cheap threats and direct damage…but Earthshaker Khenra , Soul-Scar Mage , and Ramunap Ruins allow the deck to hum like a finely tuned, mach-speed, machine. Ramunap Ruins is just extra reach for the late game, but it can really allow you to push damage and be a little reckless with your attacks when you know you have four to six damage waiting on the field to close out an opponent. In a similar vein, Earthshaker Khenra also allows this deck to last a lot longer than normal mono-red decks. Khenra pushes damage early with its ETB and then when you’ve flooded out or have been slowly ground to a minimal board state, eternalize that bad boy and smash face out of nowhere. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition and no one expects a 4/4 in a burn. Lastly, Soul-Scar Mage functions as our Monastery Mentor with its 1/2 body for one mana and prowess. Its pseudo-wither ability is also far from negligible. With the amount of burn spells, most prominently Wizard’s Lightning (aka Lightning Bolt because most creatures in this deck are incidentally wizards), Soul-Scar can reliably be a 3/4 or 4/5 hitting unobstructed because you’ve removed any blockers. Burn’s greatest strength is its ability to get going fast, disrupt anything its opponent might be doing in terms of blocking and then close out with prowess buffs or direct damage. If you’re any kind of creature deck, especially one that focuses on small creatures, burn can run you over easily if you stumble, and sometimes even if you don’t. However, if you’re playing disruption like Thoughtseize and lots of removal or thick creatures, you can essentially brick wall burn. Also, any sort of deck that gains incidental or buckets of life can be an issue, as you might expect. Rakdos Arcanist Companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den Creatures 4x Dreadhorde Arcanist 4x Kroxa, Titan of Death&#39;s Hunger 4x Priest of Forgotten Gods 4x Stitcher&#39;s Supplier 3x Young Pyromancer Instants 4x Shock 3x Village Rites Sorceries 4x Claim//Fame 3x Claim the Firstborn 1x Innocent Blood 4x Thoughtseize Lands 4x Blood Crypt 4x Dragonskull Summit 6x Mountain 3x Phyrexian Tower 5x Swamp Finally, we have what I would argue is the best deck in the format right now: Rakdos Arcanist. Also lovingly called “Rakdos, You Can’t Have Any Fun” (at least by me), this deck is brutally fast and efficient at making sure you do everything and your opponent doesn’t do anything. If you can’t tell, I lost to this deck way too many times. I have the empty ice cream containers to prove it. The name refers to Dreadhorde Arcanist , which is the card that makes this deck so potent. It also hosts a bevy of cheap, powerful spells (I’m sensing a trend), such as Shock and Thoughtseize to stall and dismantle any early gameplan. Then when your Arcanist attacks, they can then get “flashed back” at instant speed. The graveyard can easily get filled by the playset of Stitcher’s Supplier which will happily chump block to continue to keep your yard stocked for Arcanists or to escape a Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger , another effect tool to deprive opponents of resources. And if your Arcanist bites the dust, Claim can get it back for a single mana! Or if your Arcanist is lonely, you can grab them a friend out of the yard! Fame , the back half of Claim can have your Arcanist getting an attack hastily, while boosting its power to increase the range of spells it can hit, if you’ve chosen to include something like Bedevil at three CMC. Young Pyromancer rounds this deck out and goes wide quickly with how many spells are getting cast per turn. To keep up card advantage, Village Rites often is included, which gets especially dirty when you can Claim the Firstborn to clear the way for your Arcanist and then immediately grave-cast a Rites. Similar to Burn, this deck can move incredibly fast and can disrupt anything an opponent does early to trip them up. Where it excels is its ability to accumulate mountains of card advantage with getting free second casts off of most of its spells and completely stripping its opponent of options through discard. Haste from Fame and “burn” from Kroxa gives just enough reach to finish off a player who thought they had stabilized the onslaught. Aggro decks are flourishing in Historic. Cheap, powerful spells have always been at a premium and this format is full of them. The clincher is that there is a mix of these that are threats, a la Earthshaker Khenra and Soul-Scar Mage and also answers, both reactive and proactive (things like Eliminate and Thoughtseize , respectively). The Story So Far… The name of the game in Historic is to go fast and be disruptive. If you’re a slow deck or if you have no way to disrupt your opponents gameplan, you aren’t going to succeed. Decks like Merfolk and Elves don’t hold a candle to Rakdos Arcanist which can not only go faster, but can stop them at every step of the game. Azorius Auras can thrive because it can protect its threat against this disruption or get big enough to shake off burn spells. Another key is not trading resources at an even rate with your opponent. Eternalizing an Earthshaker Khenra or flashing back a Thoughtseize with a Dreadhorde Arcanist is peak card advantage when resources have run dry. A single Curious Obsession on an Ornithopter turn one can draw three or more cards in a game. Started Blasting Gun GIF from Startedblasting GIFs Lastly, prioritize your best cards and what you need to get your gameplan moving. Each deck has a few key cards that are much more important than the rest, proactively and reactively. I think my biggest mistake while testing was not taking enough mulligans. The biggest example of this is in Goblins where cards like Skirk Prospector are key to generating the mana needed to cast Muxus, Goblin Grandee , which should be your Plan A, every single game. A mull to five with one of each of those is probably better than a full grip of seven with four average to good goblins. Next time we’ll test these tenants again as we look into midrange and control decks! What can these archetypes do to overcome the decks I’ve discussed here?

After a raucous romp with Syr Carah a while ago, I think it’s time to chill out a bit. I’ve come prepared this week, I’ve done my research, and I’ve even planned both decks before starting the article! &lt;em&gt;Cue applause&lt;/em&gt;. Thank you, thank you… but in all seriousness, let’s get right into it. This week we’ll be staying on &lt;em&gt;Eldraine&lt;/em&gt; and looking to &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link external-card-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/eld/326/chulane-teller-of-tales?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/8/3/83f43730-1c1f-4150-8771-d901c54bedc4.jpg?1571282906&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Chulane, Teller of Tales &lt;/a&gt; as our commander. By the way, did you know it’s pronounced ‘Hull-an’? Told you I did my prep work this time.&lt;/p&gt; Chulane was designed to support the soft reboot of the Brawl format and he certainly has the power to do so. His triggered ability helps you keep your hand full and your mana base growing, while his activated ability can help protect important creatures or repeat powerful enter the battlefield (ETB) effects. When looking at the casual list I realized I was putting a lot of creatures into the deck to maximize these ETBs. This made me curious… Do I have enough creatures and other permanents to build a Primal Surge deck? The answer is I can certainly try! Meanwhile, for the competitive deck I was able to find an incredible primer for the iCameo (an abbreviation of the deck’s wincons) build written by the user Joking101 that helped inspire this article. iCameo is an adaptive combo build that uses Chulane’s triggered ability to nearly deck itself then win through combat damage. If you want to cut straight to the cEDH portion of the article, click HERE . Otherwise, let’s jump right in with our casual Primal Surge deck. Joking101’s Primer casual build Chulane Surges In! This deck will run you right around $250. I think this deck is actually a great example of how I want my casual decks to play. They should have a solid game plan, multiple win conditions, and should feel cool to pilot. During testing for this, I felt like I nailed all those aspects. I think I was aided in no small part by the star of the show: Primal Surge . This card is not just powerful and cool, and to use it to its full advantage we have to succumb to one of the most stringent deck building restrictions this side of Companion: don’t include any other instants or sorceries in your deck. “Why would I ever do that Eric?” Well, I’ll tell you. This will allow us to dump every other card left in our deck straight into play. Then, we immediately go for the win with cards like Thassa’s Oracle or Laboratory Maniac provided any of our other creatures’ ETBs let us draw a card. (This is where cards like Mulldrifter and Mentor of the Meek can really shine.) The unfortunate thing about this game plan is that short of Ring of Three Wishes it’s pretty hard to tutor for Primal Surge . So, we may end up drawing some of our key creatures before we find it. In order to help assuage this potential issue, we’ve peppered in some other win cons that work well with Chulane and our current shell. Eldrazi Displacer and Deadeye Navigator to generate infinite mana with Peregrine Drake or Palinchron . If we have infinite mana with Palinchron in play we can cast Chulane, Teller of Tales , if he isn’t already on the field, then bounce and replay Palinchron until we draw any of Destiny Spinner , Helix Pinnacle , or Primal Surge . If either of your Lab Man effects are still in the deck then you can just keep drawing until you win (Remember to actually play the creature before you try to draw the final time… I mean, like you wouldn’t forget, you’re cool. I’m just warning everyone else). If those have been removed or are sitting in your hand, Destiny Spinner can make some pretty threatening lands. This is doubly effective if we just cast Primal Surge and have literally all our enchantments and all our lands in play. Alternatively we can pump all that mana straight into Helix Pinnacle and pass, hoping to win on our upkeep. It’s Dangerous to Go Alone So, take these protection spells with you! Having a five mana commander and a ten mana win condition is… bold, to say the least. We can’t just sit there hoping everyone will be nice and let our terrifying spells resolve. So, we have to find some creative ways to counter spells or delay our opponents without instants or sorceries. A few creatures are just counterspells, see Mystic Snake and Frilled Mystic , but they’re a little on the pricey end CMC-wise. Fortunately for us, they come with a body and if we have Chulane out they draw us a card and can even ramp us. Ashiok’s Erasure doesn’t have the benefits of being a creature, but is very effective at protecting us from common spells like Counterspell or Swords to Plowshares . If we are going for a power turn or trying to win, it may be worth it to look to Grand Abolisher as a more definitive way to deny interaction. We don’t always want to be quite so reactive though. Sometimes it’s much better to go and blow up people’s stuff before they start causing us problems. Caustic Caterpillar and Reclamation Sage both help us hate on artifacts and enchantments. We can even bounce Reclamation Sage with Chulane to get repeated benefit out of its effect. Terastodon can also help clean up noncreature permanents, but that still leaves us lacking in terms of ways to kill our opponent’s threatening or high value creatures. To resolve this problem we can run cards like Banishing Light and Journey to Nowhere . Calix, Destiny’s Hand can let us exile even more creatures under our enchantments. Repeatable removal tied to this ability is important for us given how limited removal can be without instants and sorceries.Some cards in a similar vein to this, but much better for targeting commanders are Song of the Dryads and Imprisoned in the Moon . These enchantments prevent our opponents from returning their commander to the zone. From here let’s move on to look at some of the more staple cards in our colors and how we can use Chulane to add some unique elements to our build. Rewriting a Classic Story Primal Surge doesn’t just limit our removal and control tools. Value generation and ramp often come from instants and sorceries, so we still need to find some cheeky workarounds in that category. The deck is full of low cost creatures, so we should be able to cycle through those pretty quickly given that each of them is a cantrip when Chulane is in play. Beast Whisperer lets us double up on drawing whenever we cast a creature and with cards like Abundance we can also maximize the value of each draw. Aid from the Cowl is another great enchantment for value maximization. As long as you’re using Chulane’s bounce ability, your deck is all permanents so it’s either a permanent into play or free ramp every turn. Coiling Oracle is a great card for us whether it’s acting as draw or ramp. But there are more consistent cards for ramping I’d like to look at. Wood Elves is an obvious one, it allows us to fetch forests, so we can even grab a few of the dual lands we managed to sneak into the budget. In a deck like this Springbloom Druid is Harrow on a stick and can put in some solid work for us with a few bounces. Avatar of Growth and Solemn Simulacrum both help keep the lands coming so that we can thin our deck and make sure we have all the right colors. Obviously we’re going to be running mana dorks, but I don’t think we need to discuss Elvish Mystic for the 100th time, no matter how much I want to. Once Upon a Time (Mulligan) Let’s make sure you get your tale off to a proper start with a good first hand. For our game plan if you have a hand that is even marginally keepable with Primal Surge , you should keep it. In most hands you’ll want to have a few lands and a few other pieces of ramp. We’ll be able to hit the gas pretty well once we get Chulane out onto the field, so keeping a hand full of pretty small creatures or mana dorks isn’t actually that hurtful. Chulane is a prime target for removal, so we should prioritize any hand that includes either protection or a secondary engine we can use to bait removal or keep things going if Chulane doesn’t work out. Removal is always nice to have, but we definitely want to get off the ground and get the ball rolling as quickly as we can. Drawing into interaction later can be better than sitting on it early, but that also depends on the speed of other decks at your table. In a more aggressive pod it can be worth it to keep a few pieces of interaction and wait to play Chulane until you can really get the engines going. The full decklist for this build can be found below. Full Decklist For now though, let’s continue on to Act II of our story, with the cEDH build of Chulane, Teller of Tales . For this list we will be going forward without any budget restrictions and strictly aiming to create the most powerful deck we can. Again, this list was inspired by the iCameo primer from the user Joking101. cEDH build What is this, a Marvel Movie? Chulane, Teller of Tales has such a ridiculously good triggered ability, that combos so easily, the competitive deck requires an acronym to understand the path to victory. iCameo represents the primary cards that allow us to reach the end state of our game plan. The cards in iCameo are Intruder Alarm , Cloudstone Curio , Aluren , Mana Breach , Earthcraft , and Overburden . These six cards represent our main path to victory. Our goal with these is to constantly bounce creatures that allow us to keep drawing and replaying the same cards. All of our combos start with casting Shrieking Drake , Whitemane Lion , or having Cloudstone Curio in play and casting one mana dork with another in play already. We’ll always target the creature we just played with the bounce, or the other dork for Curio lines, and have Chulane draw us a card and put a land into play. We can continue to pay for this process by profetting mana from tapping the creature before it’s bounced and untapping a land with Earthcraft . Alternatively Intruder Alarm and any mana dorks will have the same effects. From here we can repeat whatever sustainable loop we find ourselves in. We want to draw almost our entire deck, ideally put all our lands and enchantments into play and swing out with either Finale of Devastation or Destiny Spinner . Choose Your Own Adventure The key to an adaptive deck like this is to be well, adaptive. When piloting the deck we are constantly evaluating whether this is the time to be proactive or reactive. We have a lot of great mana ramp and acceleration like Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy and Priest of Titania that can help push us toward our game plan. But we also get to run cards like Mana Drain and Force of Will . The adaptability and game sense required to play this deck honestly is a big part of why I enjoy it. I even patched things up with the Azorius Senate just so that I could run Lavinia, Azorius Renegade . I think of her as our anti-Kinnan. She pumps the brakes for others in the same way he stomps on the gas for us. Much like Lavinia, Collector Ouphe and Drannith Magistrate are two great cards for a deck like ours, which is happy to spend resources to slow down the game and relies very little on artifacts. Any of your favorite hate bear style cards can easily slot into this deck if you find that these aren’t working well in your meta. What matters is that when you need to, you can slow other players down and bring the game to your tempo. Pumping the breaks and going slow is cool and all, but have you tried going really fast? It’s also pretty sick. With a five mana commander we can’t get too trigger happy and need to be very careful about when we play him, but in the right pod we can definitely fall into the most aggressive position drawing into one of our combos very early with the right start. We have the ramp to get our mana in place very quickly with the number of dorks we’re running. Once that is all setup, we can quickly find our winning cards with tutors like Enlightened Tutor , Sterling Grove or Trophy Mage . We can even find Whitemane Lion , Earthcraft , and Overburden by transmuting Muddle the Mixture . Once we have one of the enchantments or artifacts that we need, Ranger Captain of Eos , Recruiter of the Guard and Worldly Tutor can help us find the last pieces we need to close out the game.We run Crop Rotation just in case we don’t have the right lands or need Gaea’s Cradle in order to actually have a profitable loop. What Do We Say to the God of Death? Please take a seat for this next part, I have some unfortunate news for you all… the other players at the table are trying to kill us. I know, I know, it’s terrible. Take all the time you need to process. Due to the fact that we aren’t just trying to turbo out a win con, we are probably going to need to stop them from killing us before we can actually win. So, we’ll be running some ways to protect ourselves just in case. Angel’s Grace and Teferi’s Protection can save us in the case of a single burst of damage or some powerful targeted hate. Angel’s Grace can even save us from needing to use an early Pact of Negation . If we can see a power turn coming we don’t always have to be quite so reactive though. Silence is a great card that we can use to proactively shutdown someone’s turn before they even try to go off or we can use it to protect ourselves as we look to end the game. Even further in the proactive direction are cards like Rest in Peace or Linvala, Keeper of Silence which we can use to preemptively shut down some of our opponent’s win cons. Epilogue (Mulligan) Let us conclude the story of Chulane, Teller of Tales with a wrap on how to best start a game. Given that this deck has a high density of combos, tutors, and draw we can actually afford to be just a bit less choosy with our opening hands. We really need to start the game with a strong ramp opener though. That part of our game plan is pretty immovable. From there your mulligan diverges based on the other decks at the table. Often you might look around and feel like you’re playing one of the slower decks at the table. In that case, you should prioritize keeping control and stax pieces. You still need enough draw to get your own game plan into action down the line, but stopping others from snatching the game right away can often be key. I am fortunate enough to have some friends who believe that a fourway stax mirror is peak Magic, so we can also end up in the most “aggressive” position at the table in some scenarios. In those situations we should focus more on some of the protective cards I highlighted earlier. If we have the gas to win, we need to make sure those pesky control players and other player’s stax pieces don’t get in our way. The full deck list is linked below. I’ve included some other ways to win the game in the side board and have a full write up of each win condition in the primer. I’ll see you next time!

After multiple big shake-ups in Standard, I can sort of play base Simic decks with a reasonable conscience. So today I reunited with one of my favorite decks from the beginning of this year: Temur Adventures!&lt;/p&gt; After the disappointing performance of Naya Adventures last time, this deck really brings the heat.

After a week and a half spent driving across the country and getting acclimated to the constant sunshine and mellow temperatures of Southern California, I can once again spend countless hours inside with the blinds closed playing Arena. We’re back…&lt;/p&gt; …and with quite the spicy brew! This deck actually took me quite some time to tweak and get juuust right, but I have a feeling you’ll love the end product. For this fine installment of Enter the Guildhall we’ll be following Radha, Heart of Keld as she tears a path across Dominaria leading her army of lands to victory a la Blackblade Reforged . This iteration of Radha is a departure from her “mana dork” roots, but what an explosive pump ability! And it can be repeated!! Ooooookay, huddle in and let’s talk strategy. It shouldn’t be a surprise that this deck is going to be base-green. Considering the only thing kinda Red about Radha’s design is first strike (although I guess you could make an argument for massive pump being Gruul given things like Xenagos, God of Revels ), the bulk of Radha’s ability suite will come from playing lands of all shapes and sizes; very Green indeed. Once we have a decent manabase online it’ll be time to swing in with Radha and a collection of Gruul allstars. Since we’re in Green we’ll include Questing Beast , Aggressive Mammoth , Nissa, Who Shakes the World , etc. but Red won’t be outdone. Now, I don’t want to give too much away in the intro but ahem BOY I sure am TERRIFIED of these PEAKS. More on that below. After that comes some super secret Gruul sauce I’ve wanted to try out and a dash of removal to spice it up. Presto! One haymaker fresh out of the oven. Lands, Ho! Beanstalk Giant pulls double duty as both decent ramp and coming down as an absolute wrecking ball if we’ve been doing our ramp correctly. There are few more destructive forces we can have in the late game when our entire plan is to play all the lands. Azusa, Lost but Seeking is exactly the kind of help we need to move through our deck once Radha is on the field. Given that we can play lands off the top of our library, dropping any potential dead draws straight onto the battlefield is a pretty freaking strong upside. We’re also including Dryad of the Ilysian Grove for exactly the same reason. Solemn Simulacrum is… okay so it doesn’t really need a highlight. It’s Sad Robot. But at the same time SAD ROBOT MADE IT INTO BRAWL!!! Just like Cultivate , seeing EDH staples rubbing shoulders with our Brawl ruffians just hits the feels the right way, ya know? And when that’s not enough, we’ve got Arboreal Grazer , Migration Path , and Migratory Greathorn as well as plenty of dorks like Incubation Druid and Paradise Druid making one final tour before rotation in a month-ish…I’ll really miss these guys, but I have high hopes for Zendikar! Generals, Sir. Elder Gargaroth is this year’s Questing Beast and I for one am here for it. Swapping Haste and Deathtouch for Reach and Trample as well as just a ridiculous swath of abilities make the Elder a auto-include, for better or for worse. Nyxbloom Ancient is our best chance to get a multi-activation Radha going and while I never was able to put the two together I honestly might just keep playing this deck until I do. With a chance to be tripling the land benefit as well as all the other ridiculous stuff Green can do with three times the mana Nyxbloom’s troops will leave no opponent standing. Terror of the Peaks is proof that there’s actually red in this deck. Terror is a uhh “Terror” on its own, but given Green’s propensity to be playing big creatures it’s a match made in heaven to systematically wipe your opponent’s board. And their face. Gimme That Good Gruul If you’ve been into Brawl since it’s return in Eldraine you know just how ridiculously strong Green is. I can say quite honestly it’s second to none and any decks I’ve schemed up with Green in them generally rely on it to do the heavy lifting. That being said, it would be wrong to completely ignore Radha’s Red tilt. We saw Terror of the Peaks above but there are some powerful pieces that make the perfect complement to Green’s rampant board domination. Fires of Invention might be out of Standard’s good graces, but in a deck where lands are the name of the game? The synergies are priceless. More often than not I’d end up playing a beefy spell, followed by a ramp spell, each turn until mana became a concern of the past. Is this card a lil broken? Yes. Does it still feel good to drop a Cavalier of Thorns and an Aggressive Mammoth in a single turn? (And as Julian pointed out to me, it also leaves your mana open for activated abilities, Radha approves of this development.) Rhythm of the Wild is one of Gruul’s best support pieces against the ridiculous number of people in Brawl’s queue who have the audacity to counter my spells. In the playtests I did to prepare for this article, three of the five games I played with this particular build were up against decks that played at LEAST seven counterspells each. I’m not about that, and Rhythm saved my butt many a time making sure we could play our big ugly monsters (and get Radha on the board which is usually quite difficult) Fling …is all I have to say about that. The Results So…I’m not lying when I say this deck has had the best record I’ve ever recorded with an Enter The Guildhall deck. When I finally put this list together after countless versions and tweaks I went 5-0, but I will concede two of those victories were due in part to opponent misplays. In one against Tamiyo, Collector of Tales - my opponent tried to Voracious Greatshark my Elder Gargaroth when Rhythm of the Wild was on the field which… didn’t go how they were expecting. In another close game against Thryx, the Sudden Storm I swung for lethal with a Radha that had mutated with Migratory Greathorn on top meaning my Radha was now a four cmc 3/4 with all the rest of her abilities. This became quite important when my opponent activated their Blast Zone for three (Radha’s cmc) and was left wondering why it hadn’t worked. In short, always read your opponents cards - even if you think you know what they do. They still could surprise you. That’s not to say this isn’t a super strong deck, it is! Hitting someone for 21 is satisfying to such a core level my inner caveman was jumping up and down beating his chest. This deck does what Gruul does best. Smash.

Today, Hexdrinkers treads into new territory… &lt;em&gt;Historic&lt;/em&gt;! I’ve been hearing increasing murmurs of the format and its potential greatness. With my interest in &lt;em&gt;Standard&lt;/em&gt; waning for the time being, and the recent shakeups across many formats, I figured this was a perfect time for me to fully delve into the format in a new series: &lt;em&gt;Historically Speaking…&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; But as I was booting MTGA up, I realized, I have no clue what I’m doing. So, for my benefit and your entertainment, this article will detail the beginning of my foray into Historic; how it works, the card pool, the in and outs, I’ll present my full research on all of this as a baseline for moving forward. I’ll also discuss the meta a bit, though that is in flux at the moment. This article will mostly act as a sort of primer and then I hope to get into gameplay and deck techs later on. The Island of Misfit Toys Historic is a non-rotating format exclusive to MTG Arena. This means that unlike Standard cards will stay in the format forever unless they’re banned. The Historic pool includes any cards that have ever made their way to Arena. Dominaria, Ixalan as well as the more recent pick-and-choose remasters but we’ll get to those in a minute. Since Historic was designed as a digital format, it also allows Wizards to tweak it and try new things on a much larger scale and more consistently. This is a uniqueness that you can’t get in paper formats or ones that have long standing histories. Now you may be thinking that just means bannings and unbannings will be much more frequent, but there are other ways to shake up the format that are more interesting and arguably healthier than constant banlist adjustment. Old Toys = New Toys Historic, similar to the precedent set by Modern Masters last year, has its own unique sets that inject cards directly into the format bypassing Standard completely. These Historic Anthologies are small, curated batches of cards from across Magic’s vast history designed to fill gaps in the format. Adding answers to unchecked strategies, fan favorites from history, or support for new archetypes that need a boost, that’s what these products do for the format.. Powerhouses from days gone by like Mirari’s Wake , Modern staples like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben , and even kitchen table favorites like Serra Ascendant . These anthologies cover a broad spectrum of interesting play styles and eras to make Historic truly unique. So far, three of these anthologies have been released. Historic Anthology I in November of 2019 brought 20 new cards, Historic Anthology II in March of 2020 had an increased 25 cards, and in May of 2020, Historic Anthology 3 upped the package again to 27 new cards to play with. Each one (which granted a playset of each card included) was available for 3400 gems on Arena, or individual cards could be crafted using the wildcard system. Though these are no longer available as bundles like before, Wizards has said they hope to drop new cards into Historic every quarter, so we can almost certainly expect anthologies 4, 5, etc. to drop moving into next year with a similar amount of cards (or slightly increased) and with a similar “price point”. Though that isn’t the only way new cards get added into Historic. In December of 2019, Rhys, the Redeemed was added into both Brawl and Historic as part of the Brawlidays special event. Though nothing like this has happened since, it’s safe to say that we could receive singular (or much smaller than an anthology) drops as part of special events at really any time. The most recent and largest addition to the format comes in the form of Jumpstart, the supplemental summer set released a few weeks back. Jumpstart included a host of tasty reprints as well as a slew of new cards to assist each theme (and cater to eternal formats). Because of this and with its release on Arena, Jumpstart cards also were added into Historic (with a caveat). Exciting! Time-Out So we have dedicated, curated drops, special event inclusions, as well as supplemental sets that can get added. All of these avenues mean the Historic card pool is continually growing and cards that are new and exciting as well as helpful to the meta are constantly being shuffled in. But sometimes action needs to be taken to help balance the format. I’m of course talking about the traditional way of “fixing” formats… Bannings. Something that we’ve been all too familiar with over the past year. Historic has a banned list just like other formats (in fact, it looks quite similar to Standard’s, more on that later), but it also has a second form of disciplinary action: the Suspension. Another benefit of an all digital format is that instead of having to go through the ordeal of outright banning something, Wizards can suspend cards, essentially putting them in “time-out”. A suspended card is not legal in the format, but it only remains in that status for a short time (usually one to two months). During this time, the meta can readjust and Wizards can watch to see if the format becomes healthier or if other problems arise. After the allotted time, the card either moves from suspension to banning, or can be reintroduced into the card pool. Most cards so far have gotten banned after serving their time, but some cards have been returned to the format and it sets a nice precedent for the future. Being able to more quickly take action, test the effects of certain changes, and also not having the feel-bads or negative PR of a true ban, the suspension system is interesting and probably good for Historic and one of the benefits of an all digital format. As Above, So Below Lastly, let’s discuss the Historic meta briefly, so we know what we’re getting ourselves into. Given the power of the last year and a half of printings and also the so far limited card pool of the format, a lot of it looks similar to recent Standard. Up until the suspensions, Temur Reclamation was the top deck with variation on Bant and Sultai Ramp also doing well and variations of Sacrifice and Mono-red jockeying for position. In previous iterations of the format, Fires of Invention or Winota, Joiner of Forces decks were dominant. Field of the Dead builds, usually with Golos, Tireless Pilgrim have wavered in and out of the top of the format, with Field being one of the cards that was initially suspended and then un-suspended. After digesting several metagame breakdowns and deck techs, I feel I have a reasonable understanding of the Historic metagame. One of the characteristics setting it apart from Standard is the presence of several powerful aggressive decks (though the recent bannings have started to prompt a resurgence in Standard). Mono-red, similar to its Standard counterpart, is strong and recently a top-tier version of a Goblins deck has emerged thanks to the additions in Jumpstart and Muxus, Goblin Grandee . Mono-green and mono-black both can compete, and there’s even a mono-blue aggro/tempo deck with Curiosity similar to the Mythic Championship winning deck from last year. Gruul aggro with the powerhouses Questing Beast and Embercleave has been tier one for quite a while (though it just took a hit with the explosive Burning-tree Emissary getting suspended). History is Written by the Victors With the recent regicide of Wilderness Reclamation , I suspect that these tier two decks will quickly rise to fill the space. Also, Jumpstart cards are still fresh and haven’t been tested fully, so I hope they will start to make even more impacts and soon we’ll have a new set in Zendikar Rising to shake things up even more! I’m excited to explore this fresh new format! Next week I’ll be doing a deeper dive into the current decks and testing some of them out. After that it’s off to the Hexdrinkers special laboratory to concoct up some lists of our own! Hit us up in the comments or on social media for anything you want to see me build around, and remember to stay brewin’ y’all!!

As a commander, he represents a resilient threat that’s able to provide ungodly amounts of value over the course of a long game. In this edition of Plus 40, we’re going to take a look at what kinds of cards compliment him and his powerful end-of-turn triggered ability in a Brawl and EDH setting.&lt;/p&gt; Oh, and this is Oakley here by the way. Nice to meet you and thanks for tuning in. On Removal Removal in all forms is such a pivotal and emblematic part of running a deck helmed by Athreos, Shroud-Veiled . Lucky for us, his color identity comprises perhaps the two colors best known in Magic for their effectiveness in creature removal, black and white. Ideally, we want removal that only kills a single creature to be instant speed. Nothing groundbreaking here but instant speed removal serves the auxiliary purpose of giving us an extra target every turn cycle that’s been marked by a coin counter. This helps us set up for much larger turnarounds using our opponent’s creatures against them. One of the best ways I’ve found to utilize this is to kill an opponent’s creature after they’ve declared attackers but before blockers are declared. Then, once that creature returns under your control, use it to ambush block another creature attacking you. Another form of spot removal I’d like to discuss here isn’t instant speed but provides other forms of synergy with Athreos, and that would be “O-ring” type effects: As we’ve discussed here before, targeting someone’s commander in Brawl or EDH with one of these cards generally results in the commander being sent back to the command zone. Along these same lines, when a creature with a coin counter is hit by an O-ring spell, rather than being temporarily trapped by the enchantment the creatures are exiled and instantly return to your side. I had considered various “flicker” spells for similar reasons, but found them to be too useless when Athreos wasn’t on the battlefield. Moving on to larger forms of removal, boardwipes are some of the most value-centric spells in the game. With Athreos’ coin counters this power is turned up to eleven, giving a single wrath effect the power to twist an unfavorable board state into a crushing victory: Thanks once again to Athreos’ triggered ability affecting creatures that are exiled, the pool for boardwipe options broadens to include cards like Extinction Event and Cry of the Carnarium . I’m not exaggerating when I say that cards like these are so powerful in this deck that we want to run at least four if possible. In general I like to go with the ones that can hit the widest range of creatures but between the lower life totals and lower opponent count in Brawl compared to EDH one can easily justify running something like a Ritual of Soot too. The Landbase The most striking thing about this iteration of Athreos is perhaps his mana cost, which is now double that of his previous form. Hitting land drops for the first five to six turns is imperative in this deck, as our curve is going to be steep and a turn without playing a land could spell doom to an aggressive or midrange deck. Though it may seem excessive, I would recommend running 26-27 lands to diminish the chances of missing a land drop until after we’ve resolved Athreos at least once. Thankfully, our mana base is relatively simple in this two-color deck. The auto-includes should be obvious- anything in Standard that can tap for both black and white is fair game, including of course: We’ll be running a few “color-hungry” cards in this deck as well, so fetch lands like Fabled Passage and Evolving wilds are welcome. I’d argue that even Scoured Barrens and Orzhov Guildgate deserve a spot. The important thing is that we’re hitting a land every turn early on, not necessarily that every land we’re playing is coming in untapped. And while Castle Locthwain may be a worthy include for some much-needed card draw, I’d advise against running utility lands that can’t tap for any color of mana. Field of the Dead may be enough of a menace that you’d want to run Field of Ruin just in case but missing out on that colored mana can come back to haunt you when you’d least expect it. Rest assured, we have other means of dealing with hordes of creatures. Mana Accelerants We want to get our big spells out early in Brawl or some decks will be able to run us over before we can get the ball rolling. For this reason, ramp spells in the 2-4 mana range will be our target: The theme here is ramp spells that do things for us besides just add mana. This deck values a long game with its ability to recur creatures and spells that trade one-for-many. Solemn Simulacrum , already a format staple, ticks off every bonus box for us being a four mana creature that gets us to six mana the following turn in addition to having an ETB and a dies trigger, all qualities Atheros can take advantage of. Orzhov locket is a nice mana sink during long games thanks to our high land count and we need all the card draw we can get given the limited options we have to work with. Altar of the Pantheon is an enigma, at a glance it may seem like a perfect fit for the deck, but after playtesting I found that more often than not it was actually slightly less useful to have enough devotion for Athreos to be a creature. Despite being a great blocker, he becomes vulnerable to much more common forms of removal as a creature. This is not to say that having the extra devotion is a downside necessarily, but I wouldn’t consider it a plus either. Still, Altar only adds a single devotion and the lifegain afforded by it isn’t negligible against aggressive decks so it’s probably still worth the inclusion. Overall it would be more detrimental than anything for us to try and limit ourselves to using permanents with less mana symbols just to try and keep Athreos as an enchantment-only. Creatures and Finishers Creatures with strong ETB and/or dies triggers are going to be quintessential to our success with this deck. Mentioned before, Solemn Simulacrum is a paragon example of what we want to maximize the value of Athreos’ ability when our opponents are running few or low-value creatures. In general we’ll want to keep most of our creatures in the higher CMC range to maximize the value of the coin counters we end up putting on our own creatures. Being able to resolve a boardwipe before any of your creatures even hit the battlefield for the first time is also a great way to roll out the red carpet for them. The on-color Cavaliers both provide fantastic value when recurred multiple times, and Massacre Wurm/Girl are both creatures that will at least partially wipe the board every time they enter the battlefield, which is almost always good for this deck. This isn’t to say that you should discount creatures that aren’t as synergous as the above. There are plenty of creatures that are good enough on their own merits to be worth an include: This article was constructed deliberately to leave some slots in the deck up to the reader. Listed above are some of my favorites that I found when experimenting with the deck. The main similarities between them is that they’re all hefty, evasive creatures that can help us close out a game quickly once they’re in play. Bonus: “Gotchas” I wanted to take a minute to highlight some cards that definitely should NOT be put into this build despite seeming like possibly great additions at first: It truly is a shame how poorly Athreos and his pup synergize with each other. The flavor of Kunoros is great and all but he really doesn’t belong beside his master for the purposes of this deck. Having creatures unable to be recurred by Athreos because Kunoros won’t let them back out of the graveyard after they’ve died is not going to help us win any games. Heartless Act ticks many of the boxes that define a good removal spell but is unable to outright kill any creature with a coin counter on it, making it a terrible choice for this deck specifically. Lastly, Cling to Dust is a superb graveyard hate card but an undeniable part of its draw is its escape ability which we’ll be unlikely to ever activate due to how few cards will accumulate in our graveyard over the course of the game. If things are going well for us hardly any cards will be in our graveyard at all and if they are then Cling or any other escape card in black and white for that matter isn’t going to be the pivot that we need. Eternal Upgrades Athreos shows the potential to shine in Brawl, but what about EDH? Can his powerful synergies keep up with multiple opponents with more life each? Travelling back through older sets reveals to us plenty of cards that would go well with Athreos: Strionic Resonator allows us to double down on our coin counters every turn, giving us more great removal targets and more potential allies after a boardwipe. Ashen Rider proves itself to be an exemplar amongst the many new options we have for value creatures, exiling permanents of our choice both when it enters the battlefield and when it dies. Merciless Eviction , Wrath of God and Austere Command are only a few of many examples of stellar wrath effects sprinkled throughout Magic’s history that we’d want to acquire when upgrading to EDH. Efficient removal is something we don’t see as much in modern Magic as the focus of card creation has shifted from “answers” to “threats” over the years. We want to take advantage of the good answers printed in old sets, the prime examples of which are Swords to Plowshares and Path to Exile . One thing the black and white colors seem to lack in the current Standard is good unconditional card draw, but luckily we can supplement this weakness with cards like Phyrexian Arena and Read the Bones . Finally, Ashnod’s/Phyrexian Altar can allow us to cash out early on creatures we own to potentially get another “enters the battlefield” trigger as well as some much-needed mana to cast our larger spells. Disenchant and Crush Contraband are great cards that would be available for our Brawl build if desired, but where they really shine is in EDH where we have the potential to face much more oppressive artifacts and enchantments than those that exist in Standard. Smothering Tithe embodies exactly this type of oppressive card, it will be an auto-include in many of our opponents’ white EDH decks due to its extremely high ramp value when pitted against multiple foes. Definitely play a copy of your own if you’re able to get your hands on one. Deck(s)list There’s over 25 years of Magic cards to sift through when choosing how to upgrade your Athreos, Shroud-Veiled Brawl deck so try new things and see what works best for your meta! Here’s a full list I put together that I enjoyed playing a lot in one of my playgroups: Full Decklists Plus40 &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;God of Wrath (Brawl &amp; Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/plus40/2020/08/11/athreos_plus40.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;syr carah, and why bolt is playable in every format (commander)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/the%20top%20shelf/2020/08/09/TTS-Mono-Red.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/0/8/080a249a-df47-4769-bb63-0d8ab3f2467c.jpg?1583348244&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Syr Carah, and why bolt is playable in every format (Commander)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oof, what week is it? Why are my shoes gone? Is that a satyr chasing an animated brownie? I tell ya, they know how to party on Eldraine. Anyway, I was supposed to come here and interview one of the ‘Syrs’ for a TTS I think. I feel like I have some notes from when I arrived… Oh yeah! Here we go, &lt;i&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/eld/145/syr-carah-the-bold?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/0/8/080a249a-df47-4769-bb63-0d8ab3f2467c.jpg?1583348244&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Syr Carah, the Bold &lt;/a&gt; Notes:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; The rest of the page appears to be completely blank… So, I guess I’ll go find her to see if she has anything to share about how to build her decks. Mono red would certainly be a challenge… Her ability to exile cards whenever a player is damaged definitely makes more offensive strategies pay off. Generally the combat step is where your damage is done, especially in less competitive pods. For the first build, I would probably go with something like a budget voltron deck. Using Syr Carah’s ability to exile cards as pseudo draw whenever you land an attack, then pairing red’s love of artifacts with powerful equipment could have something going. In a more competitive vein we don’t want to rely on being able to get attacks off. In reality it would be much better to never even need to tap her, given her lack of haste. That has me leaning toward a storm deck, where we can use burn spells to exile a lot of cards at once. A lot of rituals could keep things moving in terms of mana, then you just burn out your opponents with some of the artifact storm cards. Alright, I guess we should start by heading off to see the lady of the hour! The Armory As always I think we’ll be starting with the budget version of the deck. This will run you under $250 and be a great jumping off point for any future voltron decks you want to build. I thought the easiest place to start would be with the damage machine herself, Syr Carah, the Bold , so I got pointed to Carah’s room in the castle. I figured I would find her there, and be done with this article in a hot minute. Turns out, she left. But I did find some cool stuff here that seems to indicate I was on the right track. Her room appears to effectively be just an armory. There’s an Assault Suit sitting in the corner. Passing your commander around the table like this can help stack on commander damage and may even discourage others from killing her. Who doesn’t want a turn to swing the big stick? Hammer of Nazahn is just kinda sitting under her pillow. I can’t imagine it being very comfortable, but I am happy to swerve all the equip costs given that we don’t have a ton of ramp in mono red. Also, there’s a Grafted Exoskeleton sitting in the corner. Which is pretty menacing given its power to oneshot people. In the corner is a box labeled “Do NOT Open”, but I think she wouldn’t care… Well, I’ll be! Looks like our girl was hiding a few swords from us in her secret stash. Sword of the Animist is a great choice. Ramp is always nice to have in a deck without green. Sword of Vengeance gives us trample, which is always good to help bust through token decks and chump blockers. I don’t get what was so special about all this though, there’s only room for one more sword in here and so far I’m not particularly impressed… Sword of Feast and Famine ! This woman realizes we’re on a budget here right? This thing is an absolute power house, but definitely can’t just get tossed around. This card can give you an instant win, so hold out on playing it if you can, but if you find the right way to use it, slam it and take the W. How does she even find the time to put on half this stuff in the middle of battle? Oh look, it’s a little Brass Squire . That thing has to be nice when you’re running a bit low on mana. It can also help snag a piece of equipment one of your underlings was just holding onto for you. Magnetic Theft can do the same, but has the added benefit of letting you borrow someone else’s equipment if you just so happen to be missing your copy of Swiftfoot Boots . It also looks like there was a Treasure Nabber in here earlier too. It dropped off three sol rings and a bunch of artifact ramp we can borrow for a turn. This will help us equip all this and play it out in a timely fashion. Anyway, let’s go back out and look for Syr Carah. Another One Well, her room turned out to be a bust. Let’s head out to the training grounds to take a look for her. I do see a lot of Embereth knights here, but not her. We’ll watch for a while to see if we can figure anything out about how she likes to scrap. Well, I can tell you some of these squires are getting a straight up Savage Beating . Either half of that card can turn a game around and if you entwine it, you’re in for quite the reward. In addition to all the bonus damage you get, Syr Carah, the Bold will flip you four cards off the top for the turn if she manages to hit a player with every attack. Oooh, that’s not even training anymore, that is just Aggravated Assault . When paired with Sword of Feast and Famine from earlier this can give you infinite combat steps, but even without, you can get a lot of value from repeatable extra combat steps. Hellkite Charger falls into a very similar niche both in terms of repeated use and infinite combats. Not quite as permanent, but World at War and Seize the Day do have the chance to get you multiple additional combat steps for the price of a single card. Even if Syr Carah isn’t here let’s take a look at some other soldiers we can include in the deck. Voltron decks are quite weak to targeted removal, so let’s look for some other creatures who can take charge while she waits in the wings. Inferno Titan benefits a lot from extra attack steps, which allow it to blow up some smaller creatures with it’s triggered ability or just beat face even harder. This is one creature we certainly wouldn’t mind lending that Grafted Exoskeleton out to. Plague Myr already has infect, so any of our regular buff equipment will suit it quite nicely. As an added bonus in the early game it can act as a nice mana dork. Like any Infect creature, you should wait to play it out to dodge any potential hate. Finally, Steel Hellkite does great work with all those extra combat step spells allowing us to destroy permanents controlled by all the players we hit this turn. This makes for some very efficient removal on an already scary creature. A Personal Punch This doesn’t quite feel like a Syr Carah deck yet though. Her ability to draw cards is very powerful in red, where actual draw is at a premium. Looking back on what I do remember from my week here, Syr Carah at one point just went off about Rain of Embers and Volcanic Spray , which was weird in the moment, but now I’m glad she talked about it. These let you potentially clear some dorks off the board and flip four more cards off the top to keep the turn going. Price of Progress falls into a similar vein, but can actually deal some serious damage to greedier players. Thankfully it will barely hurt us, if at all, given that we are a mono colored deck. However, we are hoping for most of our activations to come from attacking. In order to clear the way for these attacks, we can make use of cards like Disrupt Decorum and Mob Rule . If our opponents have large enough boards this may even allow us to end the game when combined with a strong swing from our commander. Retracing Our Steps Looking back through everything we’ve learned thus far, we aren’t any closer to actually finding Syr Carah, but we did pretty much reconstruct the first deck for her. The voltron shell is looking strong, so let’s run through your ideal opener then move on to our second deck. In this deck you are going to want to start with 3-5 mana sources in hand. At least two (probably three) of them should be lands. Given how much we are banking on Syr Carah for card advantage, it is going to be important to get her out ASAP. Once she is on the field we’re hoping to land some protection or powerful equipment on her right away. So keeping 1-2 pieces of equipment in your opener can be a great start. We would ideally like to round out our hand with one of our substitute beaters or a burn spell for once Syr Carah is on the field, but this last spot is pretty flexible and might change if you know you’re up against control or aggro mainly. Against aggro we would prefer some removal for their ramp or a way to turn their creatures against them. Against control we should be mulling reasonably hard for a way to ensure Carah can stay on the field for a bit once we play her (e.g. Pyroblast ). The full deck list is below. Onward, to the next deck! Full Decklist A Storm is Brewing This version of the deck is about as high powered as I could get it. On commander tier lists I have seen this commander listed in the same tier as Atla Palani, Nest Tender , our first Top Shelf subject. I feel like she may fall just slightly short, but don’t tell her I said anything. Not that anyone could find her right now to tell her. At this point we’ve searched her quarters, the training ground, and I’m running out of ideas. The last part of the castle left is the basement, so let’s take a look and see if I was right about building it as a storm deck for our more competitive option. Well, at a first glance I’m seeing an Aetherflux Reservoir and a Sentinel Tower . So I think we were right on with that guess. As we try to move through our deck with Syr Carah, the Bold ’s triggered ability, these will help us close out games and kill our opponents. Well, there are plenty of classic storm cards that we can include here, even without the use of blue or other traditional storm colors. Grapeshot is an actual storm card that has huge synergy with Syr Carah. Each of the individual copies will trigger her ability, exiling another card and allowing us to see more of our deck at once. Mizzix’s Mastery and Past in Flames will allow us to recur some of our more potent damage spells as well as the rituals we can use to fuel them. These should be saved for some massive turns where you think you might be able to kill a player or even wipe the table. Bonus Round is another card that should be saved for your all-in turns. However, it can be even more of a gamble as you’re often relying on lucky top decks or Carah exiles to keep you going after you start. This is the main weakness of the deck: sometimes you’re forced to go all-in because your opponents will win given another turn cycle. On Rituals and Reductions Now that I’m looking around more, there’s some sketchy stuff down here. Sure, the giant death machines and powerful spells are spooky, but the guy on Desperate Ritual is freaking me out, I mean just look at his face. It’s a great card for our deck though, so I guess he can stay. Casting this from our hand to ramp out our commander or just ripping it off the top to keep our storm count climbing is going to be worth looking at his mug though. Seething Song is just a grown up version of the ritual, giving us enough mana to cast Syr Carah by itself. There are also a few less traditional rituals we can run too, including Runaway Steam-Kin and Vessel of Volatility . These don’t immediately proffit you mana, but can be used to store up mana for big swing turns. Neheb, the Eternal can be the biggest ritual of all if we are able to land him before passing through combat. The damage we deal in the first half of our turn can all get refunded for hopefully an even bigger second half of the turn. These ritual effects will be great for keeping us going, but we can make that mana stretch a lot further if we reduce the cost of our spells. I’m sure I saw some cool looking artifacts sitting around down here. Ruby Medallion jumps to mind as an easy include. As a mono-red deck we’ll get a lot of mileage out of that one mana reduction. Cloud Key asks us to be a bit more picky about what we are reducing, but it shouldn’t be too hard of a choice. Given how key our commander is, creature is a totally viable choice, but once she’s down I would pretty much always pick instant or sorcery depending on what was in my hand. Helm of Awakening sits at the other end of the spectrum. We’ll reduce the cost on pretty much every card in our deck, but we’ll be doing the same for our opponents. We just have to hope we can capitalize off it better than they can, or that they’re dead by the time our turn is over. BURN BABY BURN You saw the article title, we’re all here for it. There’s Lightning Bolt ’s down here! It can be used as spot removal for a lot of high value creatures or it can be a free cantrip that lets us peek at another card while continuing our burn plan. Fiery Confluence and Skullcrack both have other potential utility, such as getting past damage prevention or clearing key creatures off the board, while still letting us cycle further through our deck. Molten Psyche is a great wheel effect (don’t worry we’ve got the OG Wheel of Fortune in here too) that also deals some pretty healthy damage to our opponents. Plus it highly discourages anyone who might want to play a Notion Thief . Speaking of burn versions of other spells, Mage’s Contest is a whacky counter spell, where you’ll pretty much always win the life bet. Nobody else is running burn spells (hopefully) and other decks are likely to play shocks and use their life total more freely than us. You can even try to push them to the limit of life betting, then back out and just use a Red Elemental Blast instead, you’ll deal a ton of damage and it’ll be hilarious. We don’t want to cast these spells just once though; two spells (like heads) are better than one. Reverberate targeting a Molten Psyche can deal an insane amount of damage, while reloading your hand or just juicing up your Past in Flames . Thankfully, a lot of copy spells are also part of some strong combos. I really enjoy the versatility of combo pieces that also help push your general gameplan forward. So, running Dualcaster Mage is a great way to copy more spells, but alongside Heat Shimmer and Twin Flame it can make infinite hasty 2/2 creatures. These creature copying spells don’t always have to go in the combo, we can use them to make copies of any of our other value generating creatures as well. Increasing Vengeance is another great example of this versatile type of combo. For this combo we need any burn spell, Increasing Vengeance in the yard, and any other copy spell. By casting the burn spell and copying it with Increasing Vengeance , then copying Vengeance we get two copies of Vengeance and two burn spells. We then recopy vengeance and recopy the burn spell and repeat until everyone is dead. Every card in this combo is useful outside of it, which makes it very easy to run. Don’t Mind Us (Please)! Alright, well Syr Carah wasn’t down in the basement either. I’ll finish this up with a mulligan guide then I really gotta figure out what happened last week. This deck, much like our previous one, is all about mana generation. We want to see Syr Carah levels of mana in our opener ideally, but at least 3 repeatable sources of mana could be good enough to hold. Do not, for example, keep an opening with Fire Diamond being your only source of colored mana and just hope to draw mountains. You will get your Fire Diamond destroyed by a trigger happy control player and be very sad. Trust me. After the mana, we’re looking to have a few good burn spells which we can use to start the cycle. The perfect hand would also have an artifact tutor or one of our big artifact payoffs for the storm. Well, here’s the deck list. As always I’ve tossed a few of the possible sideboard options in if you want to tech for your meta. I’ll have to update you with where I found Syr Carah next week… Oh my god, she was passed out in the Assault Suit in her room. And it seems like we got matching tattoos of the Eldraine crest. But there’s… like a third missing? I hope this bender didn’t involve any run-ins with the Ardenvale knights… Full Decklist The Top Shelf &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Syr Carah, and why bolt is playable in every format (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/the%20top%20shelf/2020/08/09/TTS-Mono-Red.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;8/3 huge banlist update&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/breaking%20news/2020/08/03/august03bans.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.magic.wizards.com/images/hero/2018_Daily_WOTC_icon_0.jpg&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;8/3 HUGE Banlist Update&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Breaking News&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKING NEWS&lt;/strong&gt; August 3rd, 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/august-8-2020-banned-and-restricted-announcement&quot;&gt;Banned and Restricted Announcment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Here’s what happened and my takes on the changes… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Standard: Wilderness Reclamation is banned. Teferi, Time Raveler is banned. Growth Spiral is banned. Cauldron Familiar is banned. Wilderness Reclamation has been essentially the defacto best deck in Standard since the last B&amp;R. Reaching above half of the field in tournaments and having been a dominant archetype since it was printed, its time has finally run out. Growth Spiral lies in a similar vein as ramp decks that run this (normally as a four-of) make uo nearly 70% of the metagame in recent tournaments. Ramp has become synonymous with Standard as of late and Growth Spiral is one of the biggest enablers. Axed. With Temur Reclamation as a deck now removed from the format, the other two dominant forces naturally will rise up. Rakdos (and to a lesser extent, Jund) sacrifice decks, which in all variations run some combination of cat/oven are quite resilient and lethal. Removing their go-to interaction is a good way to keep them from becoming dominant. Lastly, Teferi, Time Raveler has been a cause of restriction and frustration since its printing. It’s play patterns are repetitive and completely deny a lot of other strategies or cards from being played. It was the main force holding back Temur Rec from total domination, but with that now gone, there’s no reason for Teferi to stay in the format. Overall, I wish action had been taken sooner, but these are all good choices that strike at the heart of the issue as opposed to tip-toeing around it. I am sad that Cauldron Familiar is gone as I adore Jund Food (and Chev likes Rakdos Sac, that sadist), but they would have been too dominant with the other pillars removed and cat/oven is an annoying (and on Arena, time consuming) synergy. Historic: Teferi, Time Raveler is suspended. Wilderness Reclamation is suspended. Historic has recently been mirroring Standard. For similar reasons as above, Teferi and Reclamation are getting put in time-out like Agent of Treachery , Fires of Invention , etc. before them. Like above, I like this action, especially with no rotation in Historic to remove these cards from the format in another two months. I’m still confused with the purpose and effectiveness of the suspension list, but I would not be surprised if Teferi and Reclamation make their way to being fully banned soon enough. Brawl: Teferi, Time Raveler is banned. Once again, Teferi is just not fun to play against and locks playstyles or cards out of viability. Having constant access to him in a format like Brawl makes this threat omnipresent, and with him making up 10% of the field and having some of the highest win-rates, I have no qualms with him being removed from the format. Pioneer: Inverter of Truth is banned. Kethis, the Hidden Hand is banned. Walking Ballista is banned. Underworld Breach is banned. Pioneer has steadily moved toward Modern levels of degeneracy and this B&amp;R cuts the legs out from the main pillars of the format. Inverter (comboing with Thassa’s Oracle ) is similar to Splinter Twin of Modern’s past, a versatile control deck with an, “Oops, I win,” combo. It is the most popular deck in the format for this and its skill-rewarding play, but this has lead to its synonymy being scorned. Inverter of Truth as a key piece and also lacking redundancy (Thassa’s Oracle can be replaced with Jace, Wielder of Mysteries ) will remove the combo from the format, while preserving the shell it resides in. Underworld Breach is another incredibly powerful and popular deck in the format, foregoing versatility for blistering combo degeneracy. Once again, this deck promotes no interaction and is dagnerously fast. Cutting out it’s enabler, and generally broken namesake, will cripple the combo and make Pioneer ultimately a more healthy format. Kethis combo (oh look, another combo deck) is a small portion of the metagame, but it boasts ridiculous win-rates. Similar to Krark-Clan Ironworks in Modern, this deck is convoluted and extremely hard to pilot, but rewards skill and diligence with wins upon wins. Once again, no complaints from me by removing this swift and deadly combo from the format. Lastly, Walking Ballista fell upon Heliod’s sword. Heliod, Sun-Crowned plus Walking Ballista makes for an early and game-ending two-card combo (I’m sensing a theme here). These decks weren’t necessarily dominant, but they would be the most efficient once the pillars listed above were removed. Ballista can be run in any deck and its potential to be broken is much more varied than Heliod’s, so I can see why it took the fall. Overall, this is a huge mix-up for Pioneer, essentially crippling all the best decks. Once again, similar to Standard, I applaud hitting the issues at the root, there’s no reason for other cool cards to die for broken cards’ sin’s. Slowing down the format and removing the least interactive combos should bring back the players that have been hemmorhaging from the queues. I look forward to seeing how all the new metagames shake out and you can bet that we’ll be covering the brave new worlds emerging! Hit us up on social media and let us know what you think of these bans and what you’re excited to brew now! This is Julian, over and out.

The slang that allows the incredibly complex and growing rules set of MTG to function. Without keywords, we’d be a verbose mess and no one would be able to adequately convey anything about how the game is played or what actions they’re taking. But keywords, over the course of 27 years have grown to be a massive and overflowing bunch as nearly every set brings two or more new mechanics. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; But I don’t want to talk about Companion or Escape in today’s article. I want to throw it back to the most basic of keywords, the bread and butter of casual Magic that are known as ‘evergreen’ mechanics. These are the bread and butter of magic, as creatures were flying over to chip in for damage or trampling over each other long before anyone was counting cards in their graveyard for Undergrowth or tapping mana specifically to trigger Adamant. Today, spurred by the keyword-matters creatures and pseudo keyword lords from Ikoria, I want to focus on three of my favorite keywords: Trample, Menace, and Deathtouch. Let’s dive into a build focused on each of these mechanics with the added benefit that they all completely survive rotation this Fall! Math is for Blockers A great person once said these words, “Math is for blockers. Attack with everything.” That is the exact motto of a board full of creatures with trample. Our creatures are going to be bigger than our opponents, and no matter how they block, we’re going to decimate their forces and crash through for damage anyway. The centerpieces of this deck is the humble bond between a man and his dinosaur. Courtesy of Ikoria, Quartzwood Crasher and Proud Wildbonder . Proud Wildbonder, though taking away our ability to actually destroy creatures in combat, allows us to punch through damage rapidly and efficiently. And then with all that extra damage, Quartzwood Crasher triggers giving us more fat tramplers to block and then smash even more face next turn. But these two best buds want everyone to join in on the fun, which is why they’ve brought along a bunch of beefy friends to help them. Trample creatures generally are above rate so as to make use of the keyword and we have great includes all along our curve. Warden of the Chained is a great body for only three mana and since so many of our creatures are four or more power, he shouldn’t have any issues crashing in. His other 4/4 buddy is Gemrazer who can shut down small flyers or mutate onto pretty much any of our creatures to pick off opposing artifacts and enchantments. Stonecoil Serpent is great as it can fit at any spot in our curve, either as an early way to chip in damage, or as a big stallbreaker when the board gets cluttered. Topping our curve is Thorn Mammoth , a Brawl all-star who hasn’t seen any love in Standard during his tenure since Elraine dropped. Not only does the mammoth have impressive stats, but he comes in swinging and takes out opposing blockers everytime we play another creature. To help ramp into our trunked friend as well as our other creatures, we have Gilded Goose and Ilysian Caryatid , the latter of whom gets even better with our beefed stats. “Now Julian, you can’t possibility expect to solve all your problems just with Trample!” you might say. To which I would say, ”Nonsense!” Even our removal spells have trample! Ram Through and Flame Spill each punch the rest of their damage through to the opponent after removing a blocker or pesky utility creature and are welcome additions to this deck. Add in some Garruk’s Uprising s for card draw and Embercleave , cause it’s Embercleave and we’ve got one buff build! Tramp Stomp Artifacts 2x Embercleave Creatures 3x Gemrazer 2x Gilded Goose 4x Ilysian Caryatid 4x Proud Wildbonder 4x Quartzwood Crasher 3x Stonecoil Serpent 2x Thorn Mammoth 3x Warden of the Chained Enchantments 3x Garruk’s Uprising Instants 2x Flame Spill 4x Ram Through Lands 4x Fabled Passage 9x Forest 7x Mountain 4x Temple of Abandon Menacing the Witness Menace is the “newest” of the keywords we’re discussing today as Wizards has now made this the go-to specific blocking conditions after discarding Fear, Intimidate, etc. Menace is great because it makes our opponent essentially only able to block half of our creatures, makes chump blocking essentially impossible, and sometimes makes our board unblockable if we keep removing their creatures. The powerhouse duo in this build are Sonorous Howlbonder and Labyrinth Raptor ! These two make our creatures incredibly hard to block, let alone trade with favorably (or even unfavorably). Plus our Raptor’s ability will help manage their board from getting out of control and can pump up the creatures they didn’t have enough blockers for. Unlike the trample deck, our menace creatures are fast and low to the ground which helps us curve out and apply pressure quickly. A perfect example that also fuels further draws is Stormfist Crusader . Already a powerful card in Knights’ decks, it shines alongside our other mean muggers. Cavern Whisperer is on the bigger end of our curve, but helps strip our opponent of resources to keep up the onslaught. Grimdancer falls in the middle of the two and can play offense and gain us life or defense and hold back threats with deathtouch To help keep blockers to a minimum and to remove opposing haymakers, we’re running several removal spells. Fire Prophecy and Eliminate are both efficient and we’ve got Blood Curdle s for flavor. We’re also running two excellent creatures who double count as removal: Bonecrusher Giant and Murderous Rider . Though they don’t have menace, their value is undeniable and with Blood Curdle or Call of the Death-Dweller they can gain the buffs from our Howlbonder or Raptor. Call of the Death-Dweller is also key to get back either of our menace ‘lords’ that might have been removed. Mean Muggin’ Artifacts 2x Embercleave Creatures 4x Bonecrusher Giant 3x Grimdancer 4x Labyrinth Raptor 4x Murderous Rider 4x Sonorous Howlbonder 4x Stormfist Crusader Instants 2x Blood Curdle 2x Eliminate 3x Fire Prophecy Sorceries 3x Call of the Death-Dweller 2x Tentative Connection Lands 4x Fabled Passage 7x Mountain 8x Swamp 4x Temple of Malice The Kiss of Death Deathtouch is a rarely used keyword and is usually relegated to small, insignificant creatures (except The Gitrog Monster and Grave Titan ). Used to symbolize the small but deadly creatures that inhabit our own world, it’s primarily a defensive mechanic, great for stalling games with our opponent fearing losing their bomb to our deathtoucher that we’ll gladly make a trade for. On the flipside, deathtouchers can also make great attackers primarily because they are so small and our opponent won’t want to trade to block, that they’ll allow us to chip in turn after turn for a considerable amount of damage. It’s these two angles that we want to maximize in this all deathtoucher’s deck! There isn’t a ‘bonder’ from Ikoria to give a buff to our deathtouch creatures, but M21 gave us something arguably better in Hooded Blightfang . Now, every attack will drain our opponent for one. Add that to the damage from them most likely not blocking and we’re looking at a three or four lifepoint swing per creature! Add on the ability to merc planeswalkers and the Blightfang is a powerhouse. The other extremely notable card in this deck is…. Questing Beast . Yes, I know, we sold out. I don’t like this card either, but as a creature with deathtouch it’s too good to ignore. This will punch in a lot of damage for us and up our clock since most of our creatures are one or 2 power. Speaking of our other creatures, here’s a slew of our rank and file deathtouchers. Fetid Imp can cover the skies either offensively or defensively. Foulmire Knight provides card advantage and/or a cheap venomous body. Grim Dancer (remember them?) and Boot Nipper both are versatile in their uses. Thieves’ Guild Enforcer is new from M21 and provides a pseudo combat trick with its flash. Chevill, Bane of Monsters will provide us card advantage whenever we do need to trade off our creatures or if we use a Ram Through to remove anything pesky. Lastly, Call of the Death-Dweller and a singleton Nethroi, Apex of Death gives us grindability with a few Village Rites to churn through our library. Truly a dangerous deck to tangle with. A Gentle Caress of the Inner DIE Creatures 3x Boot Nipper 2x Chevill, Bane of Monsters 3x Fetid Imp 4x Foulmire Knight 3x Grimdancer 4x Hooded Blightfang 1x Nethroi, Apex of Death 4x Questing Beast Instants 4x Ram Through 3x Village Rites Sorceries 3x Call of the Death-Dweller Lands 4x Fabled Passage 6x Forest 8x Swamp 4x Temple of Malady Well that’s it for this week!

There’s a lot of things going on with our crew recently, including another new author to our team! He’s hoping to join me in the mighty world of Brawl so hopefully you’ll be hearing from him soon…in the meantime welcome to a brand new series!&lt;/p&gt; Plus40 For each Plus40 we’ll be highlighting a Brawl Commander and a powerful deck strategy while also including what additional 40 cards will make that deck a Commander allstar come rotation. It’s a way to hold on to your favorite strategies and cards past the Brawl expiration date, or as a way to just level up your game into a Commander meta. And considering it’s a set list of 40 cards, you can transform back anytime! Our first swing at this versatile new series comes all the way from Dominaria in Core Set 2021… Welcome to the Jungle Today we’ll be discussing everyone’s favorite Zhalfirin. GIVE IT UP FOR TEFER- Kidding. Instead, show some love for Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse ! Now, I know what you’re thinking and I was the exact same way. “Wait, a card that triggers off of card-draw … but it’s mono green. Chev. Buddy. This is a clear example of what should be in the 59 of someone with a more ‘blue’ persuasion.” And I can see the logic, BUT in this wild wild world we call standard Blue is not the only one drawing cards at ridiculous speeds. In fact, call me a heretic but between Guardian Project , Elder Gargaroth , Return of the Wildspeaker , and Keeper of Fables I would say Green might almost be drawing MORE cards than Blue….No one better tell Julian though, it’ll kill him EDITOR’S NOTE: Julian here. Smh, but it’s true. I’ll save y’all the rant. Basically what I’m saying is, there’s a chance we can build an entire two decks around green’s ability to draw cards and not even miss the islands a little bit. The Game Plan At her core Jolrael wants to be doing two things: making cats and buffing said cats with her mana sink ability. Drawing cards will have a positive effect on both since her buff is tied to cards in hand and will make our tokens. We’ll also include some extra go-wide synergy cards to sweeten the deal. That’s pretty much it! We want to be drawing cards, and we want to be loading up on as many Overrun variants as possible. Cats, Go These are all absolute powerhouses that I’m still not sure Green should have access to. Guardian Project is the most clear-cut draw engine for singleton formats considering we’ll never have more than one creature with a given name, and once it’s down, not only will each creature cast be generating tons of extra value, but Jolrael will be able to drop cats like nobody’s business. The Great Henge benefits us for casting creatures by drawing for each while also being an insanely powerful mana rock. Or more accurately a mana… tree… alien artifact. Lastly, Return of the Wildspeaker is an allstar giving us the option to draw a ton of cards OR as an overrun with our cat army. Either way it plays into our strengths to a tee. Rounding out this cast of characters is Elder Gargaroth , a pushed Green mythic from Core Set 2021 and Beast Whisperer who provides us a third back-up effect for casting creatures and drawing cards. Honestly Green, this is getting out of hand! Cats go Prrrr And what do we do once we’ve amassed so many cats we don’t know what to do with them? Well. We make them really big and we bap our opponent on the nose so violently they concede in a flurry of whiskers. Ideally, we’re using Jolrael’s ability to give everyone +x/+x on a hefty hand, but everyone needs backup. End-Raze Forerunners is like a little Craterhoof Behemoth but with more Boar, and a static +2/+2 with vigilance and trample for our creatures. Feline Sovereign is a cat anthem with a slightly relevant pro-dog clause, but also has a decent artifact or enchantment removal trigger. Overcome is a less mana-restrictive Overrun , but doesn’t provide quite as big a buff as the eternal staple. I’m also really interested to try out Klothys’s Design . While it doesn’t give trample, I feel like the average mono-green board state can put big numbers to our devotion count so I feel like the trade-off is worth giving a chance. Backup Squad At The Hexdrinkers Brawl Battalion we generally like to stay just competitive enough that we’re still able to come out positive, but not so competitive we’re ever restricted in our deckbuilding. That being said, it will always pay to have a suite of top-tier interaction and win-cons for when the going gets rough. Veil of Summer and Heroic Intervention are critical to protecting your creatures, and will give even the most savvy Dimir mages a run for their money. Nissa, Who Shakes the World is an excellent include from a mana perspective, a creatures perspective, and just a casual game-winning perspective. She doesn’t have much to do with cats but sometimes you just gotta beat someone with animated trees. Am I right, Ents? But wait! There’s more! Thaaaaat’s right everyone it’s time for the Commander build. Now, obviously there are cards that could be swapped out of our Brawl baby for a more intense final product but that’s not what this is about, son! We’re talking a straight Brawl DLC! This is like a season pass to all things Jolrael that can just be combined with your existing list for that little extra oomph! We’ll be sticking with the same themes: drawing more than once per turn and going wide, but adding the more powerful older siblings to a lot of our Brawl picks. Add a classic package of protection and removal to round things out. Talk less, Draw More Well, we won’t be causing any confusion about what we’re against or what we’re for, we’re FOR drawing a ridiculous number of cards. We’re AGAINST our opponents being able to do anything about it. The Archive is just absolutely insane. Now, a slightly cheaper draw-only version was just printed for blue ( Teferi’s Ageless Insight ), but feels like Blue can use all the help they can get these days so I ain’t complaining. You go Blue, you’ll get back on top one day. Now Alhammarret doesn’t really get us more cats…at least when used on your turn. It just lets you draw more cards. Get this activated on an opponent’s turn though and we’re seriously cooking. (That’s exactly why we’re packing Endless Atlas in this upgrade package.) Idol of Oblivion probably won’t help us generate any more cats (since it needs a token played that turn to activate), but I think nine turns out of ten it’ll net you an extra card which is still an amazing value for a two mana artifact. Lifecrafter’s Bestiary is essentially a second Guardian Project for a small mana investment, but also lets you scry every turn for whatever you need. (If you’re feeling like a little extra bling, sub this or Idol for Sylvan Library .) Going Bigger So we kind of hinted at this above but remember how End-Raze Forerunners is Something Something lite? WELL GUESS WHO’S HERE!! Boom. Game over. Hulk SMASH. {pics of Triumph of the Hordes, Thunderfoot Baloth, Finale of Devastation} Triumph of the Hordes is one of the more interesting Overrun variants, swapping a larger buff for infect. Even if your opponents groan a little, this is always a good way to end the game. Thunderfoot Baloth stands out in the fact the buff doesn’t actually go away until your commander does which could let you eek out a couple more turns of super buff cats. And then there’s Finale of Devastation . I….I don’t think I ever fully grasped what this card actually did but now that massive price tag makes sense. Not only is it a tutor that can search your graveyard for a game-winning piece but if you’re playing this late enough creatures will get +10/+10 and haste.. There’s a non-zero chance I’m going to be running out and getting a copy as soon as I finish this article. Jeez. Treat Yo Self. So far we’ve kind of stayed in the lanes designated by our Brawl build, but while Brawl is improved by the innovation required by a smaller card pool, Commander really shines due to the sheer volume of synergies available in lanes that haven’t been printed in a while. {pics of Doubling Season, Parallel Lives, Beastmaster Ascension} Doubling Season and Parallel Lives give us double the cats for double the fun, making up for the one-cat-per-turn limit on Jolrael’s army. Beastmaster Ascension has seen a lot of attention recently for just giving a permanent bump to all your creatures once you get it up there. There’s still a few more goodies in there that fit into the above categories or provide some extra flexibility but I’ll let you find them out for yourself, or let me know if I missed anything in the comments!

I would additionally discourage any of you from committing crimes such as mana cheating, ramping without a permit, or attempting to win a game against an Azorious deck. Here to help me speak to this is our honored guest of the week, &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/rna/189/lavinia-azorius-renegade?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/4/c497d496-1232-4614-93b0-9864fa93c29f.jpg?1584831655&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Lavinia, Azorius Renegade &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Lavinia’s high impact passive effect and low casting cost make her a threat right out of the gate. Regardless of the level your table typically plays at there are great options for Lavinia, which makes her perfect for this series. Our budget deck will be up first today, focusing on a combination between group hug and pillow fort strategies. With this we’re hoping to win a resource battle against the last player left. Until then we’ll be encouraging our opponents to bring each other down, while we slowly turtle up. The second deck today will be our high power deck and will focus on locking our opponents out with Omen Machine and Knowledge Pool . Then ends the game by exiling our opponent’s library, or just beating face. Hunker Down and Cuddle Up: As usual, the budget version of the deck should cost you under $200. I know the tapped out says it will be more, but it’s pricing Islands at $2.50. Don’t buy islands for that much, and please report anyone selling them to you at this rate to the Azorius Senate. Anyway, our plan will be to discourage our opponents from attacking us, while giving them the resources to kill each other. When asked for a quote about her commander style Lavinia, Azorius Renegade had the following to say: “I will personally stop those who seek to cheat or gain unfair advantages. I will root them out and crush them under the boot of justice! Their crimes-” Yeah, you get the point. With an attitude like that, we’ll want to see her on the field early and often to stop our opponents from pulling too far ahead of us. We aren’t stopping them from playing cards (yet), we just want to make sure they have all their paperwork in order first. We’ll end the game with cards like Approach of the Second Sun or Tidespout Tyrant . If the need arises we can even borrow some of our opponent’s cards to win the game a la Diluvian Primordial . But in order to get this far in the first place, we’re going to need to get the shields up and stay safe till we feel comfortable entering the fray. Our opponents are going to see Azorius and just immediately put us at target number one. It’s okay, they don’t understand the full glory of blue white. Anyway, when they start to get the lead out, it’s time to pillow up or shut up. Settle in for a Long One: The goal of the pillow fort strategy is to defend yourself by seeming like the worst target possible. If your opponents want to attack you, they’ll have to deal with cards like Propaganda and Ghostly Prison , as well as their big brother Sphere of Safety . If they want to mess with your game plan they’ll need to take it up with Tithe Taker and Unsettled Mariner . Another great defensive card, Illusionist’s Gambit emphasizes the Azorius Senate policy ”Don’t start nothin’, won’t be nothin’”. We can also more actively try to lockdown the game with some cards that pump the breaks on our opponents for whole turns. Lavinia of the Tenth slots into this category well and will allow us to stop opponents from attacking with any of their smaller creatures for a turn. This version of Lavinia’s Detain effect even prevents mana abilities from being activated. One turn lockdowns aren’t going to be enough though, let’s look at some continuous effects that really shut our opponents down. Fatespinner and Angelic Arbiter both force our opponents to decide if they want to cast spells or attack each turn and can be massively disruptive if played correctly. As a bonus if these somehow prevent other players from winning or making big tempo plays, the other folks at the table may even appreciate these cards (don’t count on it though). Lockdown doesn’t always send a strong enough message though, sometimes we need destruction. Karmic Justice answers this call perfectly and reassures our opponents that the Azorius Senate knows how to smash just as well as Gruul, we just have more restraint. Eventually, things will inevitably get out of hand with one of our opponents, so we’ll need to be able to reset them to a position where our taxes and fees will keep us safe. Terminus and Single Combat can help us clear off the board without completely losing everything. Either everything ends up back in people’s decks, ours included, or we get to keep a key creature, like Lavinia, on the board. Tragic Arrogance is a great card to sub in if either of these don’t fit your style. Not every problem requires the nuclear option though, sometimes we can pinpoint a key permanent that is offsetting the balance of things. For that, targeted removal will be our best friend. Winds of Abandon is a great middle ground here, allowing us to either shut it all down, or nail a key target. For our dedicated single target removal, we still like that idea of keeping the balance. Generous Gift lets someone keep a blocker, but can remove any permanent that we believe is problematic for us. Fractured Identity leans in the other direction. If someone pulls out way ahead by dropping a game ending creature, just teach them that sharing is caring and spread that wealth around the table. One last card I want to highlight is Oblation which is still great removal, but also hints toward the other archetype we’re mixing into this deck, Group Hug. EDH Politics 101: Group hug is another strategy that tries to push the aggression off of you. But this time it does so by giving the other players resources and playing symmetrical effects. You can usually negotiate your way out of any early aggression using these effects. Later, you might be able to exchange some of that goodwill for help on cards like Fact or Fiction and Truth or Tale . If you really trust another player, you could even pull off a big Epiphany at the Drownyard . Some great creatures that fit into this game plan are Kami of the Crescent Moon , Orzhov Advokist , and even Jace’s Archivist . These cards initially appear weak because you’re spending a card, but everyone gets the same benefit as you. The key here comes with finding ways to break this parity. For Jace’s Archivist this can come from causing your opponent’s to discard key cards while giving you a free reload. While with Kami of the Crescent Moon we are hoping to spend less cards getting to the late game than our opponents, so we’ll be profiting more from each draw. There are a lot of different ways to manipulate or control the group’s opinion of you. You can play cards that buff their creatures specifically but ensure you aren’t at risk, like Martial Impetus or Vow of Flight . Alternatively you can let them decide how your cards play out, even though it usually just does what you wanted, using Will of the council cards. Two perfect examples of this are Split Decision and Council’s Judgment . Sometimes you just want to give out resources to remind people you’re everyone’s best friend. Minds Aglow , Otherworld Atlas , and Temple Bell will help you keep people’s hands full and keep them happy with you. It doesn’t hurt to ensure that your Recurring Insight will always net you a full hand either. At its heart this is still a control deck that will take some good thinking to pilot well. So, make sure to keep an eye on players’ resources and know when to be giving out handouts versus when to lay down the law. Starting Your Political Career: This is a new section I’ll be adding to each of these articles, where I give a brief rundown on how to identify a good starting hand and how to make use of it. For this deck we don’t really have any ramp outside of a few artifacts and our average CMC is a bit high. So, we’ll be looking for three to four mana sources in our starting hand. This will ensure that even if we don’t see lands for a little while we can keep playing on curve. After that, make sure that you have one or two cards that can help keep you safe in the short term. These could come from the Pillow Fort or the Group Hug category, we just want a way to put the shields up early. After that we will be looking for either draw or a long term plan. If we can find a consistent draw engine we’ll be well stocked with resources into the midgame. If we have one of our win cons or another high value spell we can try to politic our way into making that as high impact as possible. Take a look below for the full decklist with a small sideboard of other cards you may want to include. Full Decklist The True Glory of Azorius Now that I’ve served half my sentence.. Uh I mean, now that I’m halfway done with my volunteer work, onto the second deck of this article! This second deck isn’t meant to lock down the first time mana-cheating offenders, this deck is meant to lay down the law against the serious rule breakers. We won’t be doing any hugging and there certainly won’t be any pillows, this is going to be full blown Lavinia, Azorius Renegade cruel control with a lockout win condition. Based on her effect, if we land Omen Machine or Knowledge Pool and have Lavinia on the board we will either prevent our opponents from ever casting another spell or prevent them from ever drawing another card. This is a relatively hard lock, but can still be picked if we don’t have some counter magic or removal ready for a few of the cheeky work arounds. Once we have our opponents shut out we can clean up the table in a few different ways if our opponents don’t concede. Jace, the Mind Sculptor should be able to safely get off his ultimate at this point, which will easily secure us the win as we go around the table removing everyone from the game. Helm of Obedience and Rest in Peace will allow us to do the same thing, again one player at a time. As a bonus, Rest in Peace is just a good stax card that we can play out as we feel necessary. Finally, we could always just slowly beat them to death with our creatures, regardless of how small they may be. Throw the Book at Them: Given that we are trying to win the game by playing our commander, a six mana artifact, and we want to keep some mana open for counter magic, we will not be the quickest deck at the table. So, we need to control the flow of the game until then. Mana Breach , Damping Sphere , and Winter Orb should help us prevent our opponents from ramping too hard or getting out in front of us from a resource perspective. Juntu Stakes will also help us keep our opponents mana dorks down without hurting our game plan. We’ll be running some cool planeswalkers to help keep our opponents from winning as well. Gideon of the Trials literally says that they can’t win the game while he or another beefcake is around. This is perfect for stopping a Thassa’s Oracle or Laboratory Maniac win. On top of these other cards, Narset, Parter of Veils and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria can do a lot to slow down our opponents. We also have plenty of creatures that we can use to help lock down our opponents. Alms Collector offers you a slightly worse Notion Thief without needing access to black mana. Card draw in white is hard to come by, so I’m always happy to borrow some from the other players at the table. Drannith Magistrate is a relatively new card that will do great work for us. It works similar to our commander for either of our locks, or can function as an early stax piece. Linvala, Keeper of Silence and Hushbringer both help us lock out creature abilities and win conditions, which can be very important depending on the metagame at your table. Finally, Nimble Obstructionist is an uncounterable Stifle that draws us a card. As a control deck, we are obviously going to be running a healthy amount of counterspells and removal. Baral, Chief of Compliance will help us get these spells out and reward us for successfully countering any of our opponent’s nasty ideas. Fierce Guardianship will help us prevent anyone from messing up the lock, ideally for free if Lavinia is already on the board. Pact of Negation won’t punish us too badly because in theory we are free to waste five mana the turn after our lockdown goes into place. Delay and Ertai’s Meddling allow us to delay a spell, then counter it with Lavinia, Azorius Renegade or Drannith Magistrate . Chain of Vapor will help encourage our opponents to hurt each other and themselves while still being functional removal. Even if this gets turned back on us, we’ll end up getting more benefit out of it because we suffer less when removing our lands. Speaking of removing lands, Armageddon and Cataclysm will both make appearances in this deck. You may wonder if I’m running Ravages of War ; I’m not. In my opinion there are good ways to spend $150 improving your deck and bad ways to do it. Including that card over another one of our spells wouldn’t dramatically change our win rate and could even reduce it depending on the meta. It’s not worth it. The Keys to the Kingdom: The final element of this deck I want to highlight is the cards that help us in the resource battle. As a control deck we are often trading down, going one for one with different opponents. Our stax pieces will help slow down the other players at the table, but that’s still not enough. Smothering Tithe and Land Tax will help us stay in the game from a mana perspective. As other players ramp or draw, we will naturally generate resources off their cards. Shoutout to Tithe which can also help snag us some lands. Rhystic Study and Mystic Remora fall into the same category, but instead help us keep our hand full of spells that can impact the game. Mangara the Diplomat also keeps our hand full, but instead comes on a reasonable body for a similar cost. Windfall can also be used to reset our hand after we’re low on resources and cause our opponents to discard some of their high value cards. This move is particularly effective if anyone else at the table has been tutoring a lot or you suspect they may go for the win next turn. Speaking of tutors, we can’t just rely on draw to find our lock cards. Treasure Mage happens to hit both Omen Machine and Knowledge Pool , which works perfectly for us. Enlightened Tutor is a classic for strategies like ours. As a nice cherry on top it also works as a way to find key stax pieces or other important cards before we’re ready to win. Mystical Tutor can’t grab either of our artifacts, but can hit any of our other tutors as well as removal or counter magic. Finally, Whir of Invention works very well with all the artifacts we’re running and allows us to tutor either of our lock cards straight to the field. I AM THE SENATE: In this version of the deck we have a lower CMC and a lot of artifact ramp. I would still look for three mana sources or fetch lands, but place a stronger emphasis on having some amount of artifact ramp in the hand. Once you’re comfortable with that, we need to have some early counter magic. Other players are going to start looking for the win as soon as their first turn, so we need to be ready to stop them. In the same vein we’ll need one or two of our early stax pieces to deny our opponents the ability to look for that early win. Finally, resource generation is still important. Once we’ve blown through our opening hand, which will be very fast, we need to be able to reload and keep up the pressure. In conclusion, you’re priorities in order are: The full deck list is given below. Well, now that I am done with my volunteer work I think I’m gonna hop off this plane for a bit. Maybe take a tour of Eldraine. I heard Syr something or other was hosting a party and those are always a fun time. See you next week! Full Decklist The Top Shelf &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;No More Ms. Nice Azorius (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/the%20top%20shelf/2020/07/23/TTS-Azorius.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;on the hunt for combos (commander)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/the%20top%20shelf/2020/07/16/TTS-WhaleWolf.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/c/4/c44cfa67-6276-4d23-9f25-a0576bfe1d25.jpg?1591234307&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;On the Hunt for Combos (Commander)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome back to another article in &lt;em&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/em&gt; series. This week we will be dipping back into the well of commander precons. &lt;em&gt;C20&lt;/em&gt; featured the return of &lt;em&gt;Partners with&lt;/em&gt;, a mechanic I found very interesting and was happy to see again. I think that &lt;em&gt;Partners with&lt;/em&gt; outshines the original &lt;em&gt;Partners&lt;/em&gt; mechanic because it allows the design team to build in bespoke synergies or game plans with a lower risk of accidentally creating something overpowered. In an effort to branch out from my comfort colors of Naya, I’ll be looking at a Sultai deck this week! (I won’t give up green, you can’t make me. I have rights!)&lt;/p&gt; Cazur, Ruthless Stalker and Ukkima, Stalking Shadow are great partners, where the synergy immediately jumps out at you. Swing in with Ukkima to get buffs from Cazur and quickly snowball into a commander damage win or burn for a bunch when your whale wolf leaves the battlefield. In this article we will be exploring a build that falls into this high synergy, partner focused, category and a very interesting competitive take utilizing Food Chain combos. The Power to Bite Let’s jump into our budget list first. The deck should run you under $200 and offer a well-tuned gameplan. It will focus on beefing up Ukkima, Stalking Shadow to land powerful hits and to punish our opponents for removing him. We want Ukkima’s growth to be permanent, so we are going to be focusing mainly on +1/+1 counters as opposed to combat tricks and temporary buffs. When building this deck, my mind immediately jumped to cards like Hardened Scales , Winding Constrictor , and Corpsejack Menace . These cards will give us significant incremental growth to bolster the counters we are already building up on Ukkima. Strategies that rely on counters always love Proliferate, so we can toss in Thrummingbird and Inexorable Tide as well. Finally, I always find it helpful to sometimes just win the game, so let’s have Simic Ascendancy as our cherry on top. There are a few all-star cards when it comes to +1/+1 counters we get to include that I’m very excited about. Reyhan, Last of the Abzan is great at saving the counters from our dying creatures and getting them back on Ukkima where they belong. Forgotten Ancient also does a great job of sharing the wealth of +1/+1 counters, eventually funneling them onto our favorite Whale Wolf. Vorel of the Hull Clade and Hydra’s Growth let us stomp on the gas and kill our opponents much faster by just doubling the counters on Ukkima. Speaking of killing our opponents quickly… Don’t tell anyone I told you, but Tainted Strike is super gross in this deck and you should absolutely run it. I can’t say it’ll win you friends but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t win games. Now that Ukkima is big, we’ve painted a target on our backs. People will try to lock him down but may be careful about killing him for fear of the damage he’ll do when he dies. I expect to see a fair amount of hate aimed at us as soon as Ukkima’s any larger than 6/6. We can always try to prevent his destruction, but then we have to go through the whole rigmarole that is the commander tax and dodging counterspells. Instead let’s just swerve that and blink that boi! Displace and Ghostly Flicker are spells that will help us save Ukkima and Cazur from any targeted removal. Evacuation and Flood of Tears act as the nuclear option, allowing us to fully reset the board, sometimes we even get to put Ukkima or another key creature right back into play. Under the Sea: Darlin blue’s better, down where it’s wetter, take it from me! Let’s talk draw. In our last Top Shelf article we were relying on green to move through our deck… Spoiler: that’s not very good. In this deck we’ll still be looking to green for cards like Greater Good to help with drawing cards, but now that we have blue and black a lot of new doors are open to us. Cold-Eyed Selkie and Edric, Spymaster of Trest will work very well with Cazur, Ruthless Stalker , allowing us to get more benefits from our attacks and draw some cards. Mystic Remora , also known as THE FISH, will be a great draw tool for us. You’ll never get tired of interrupting your friends with “You gonna pay four for that?” (Another spoiler: they probably won’t be paying four) Of One Mind and Treasure Cruise let you draw multiple cards for one mana in a lot of situations, which is really gonna help us find our powerful cards. Finally, shoutout to Tezzeret’s Gambit for being a totally fine draw spell that also gives us more proliferate. Read the Bones is a classic example of Black’s style of draw, turning in some small portion of your life for resources. Sign in Blood and Night’s Whisper are both similar draw options, so we’ll be running both of those as well. When we combine black with blue we get some unique draw adjacent effects. Fallen Shinobi and Mythos of Brokkos are great examples of resource generation that don’t necessarily fit into the category of draw. Now that we can move through our deck even faster, we want a lot of mana to play as many of these awesome cards as quickly as possible. There’s not a ton of unique ramp in here so I’ll keep this quick. We’re gonna run a standard set of mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic as a baseline. Then drop in a nice mix of ramp sorceries. Migration Path is a nice new ramp spell, but who could forget the classics such as Kodama’s Reach and Cultivate . We’ll put all of ‘em in just to be safe. Spells like this are actually going to work really well with Evolution Sage to keep those counters growing. Hunting Tactics: So, we have our battle plan and our pack (pod? pock? We’ll stick with pack) behind us. Now let’s start circling in for the kill. Blue and black are going to give us the ability to easily disrupt our opponent’s game plan as we are working on our own. Counterspell is the OG, but Arcane Denial is a personal favorite. Conditional counterspells and removal are often a great include. It’s pretty easy to find options where either the condition is easy to manipulate or accidentally achieve. Drown in the Loch is a great card in this category. Finally, cards like Putrefy and Beast Within will help us clear out any final permanents stopping Ukkima from going in for the kill. That’s the full story for our first deck. As usual I’ve included some options that you may want to toss in from the maybe board depending on your preference or meta. Take a look at the full list below and let’s head onto our next deck! Full Decklist In R’lyeh We Wait Dreaming Now, the competitive version of this deck is much better known than the Atla Palani, Nest Tender deck from last week, but I’m still excited to give my take on it. As I mentioned earlier, we’re going to be mainly looking for a Food Chain combo to win the game. Eternal Scourge and Misthollow Griffin are both able to be cast from exile after they’re banished to the shadow realm via Food Chain . This will allow us to generate one additional colored mana (which can only be spent on creatures) each time we go through the loop. Repeat said loop an infinite amount of times and Boom! infinite mana! This will allow us to repeatedly cast, Ukkima, Stalking Shadow , who when exiled or returned to the command zone is able to damage equal to his power. So we’ll be looking to end most games by spending our infinite mana casting and exiling him over and over again, wiping the table. I personally do not like Thassa’s Oracle . I think Demonic Consultation and Tainted Pact wins with this card are far too generic and easy to pull off in any UBX shell, BUT! This is one of those UBX shells, so we’ll be running them and I’ll find another time or article to offer my full opinion on this. Jace, Wielder of Mysteries will act as a nice backup to the Oracle. If you happen to feel the same as me, it’s actually really easy to swap out these four cards with Deadeye Navigator , Peregrine Drake , and Palinchron . This also eliminates the need for a singleton manabase, which can help cut down on deck cost. In this version we just create infinite mana then blink Ukkima for the win, instead of exiling him with Food Chain . On the Hunt… For Our Combo Now that we know how to win with this version of the deck, let’s sniff out those combo pieces. Standard black and blue draw are going to help us build a solid foundation to find the cards we’re looking for. Necropotence and Notion Thief will be able to hopefully allow us to draw a lot of cards at once. While we’ll be running some of the more ubiquitous draw spells, like Ponder , Brainstorm , and other cantrips, we get to run some very weird cards that border on being tutors because we are a Food Chain deck. Foresight and Manipulate Fate let us pre-exile either Eternal Scourge or Misthollow Griffin . Extract will also enable our Food Chain combos, but can be used to remove key combo pieces from your opponent’s decks if it comes to it. There are more cards that ride this line between tutoring and drawing cards. Lim-Dul’s Vault and Plunge Into Darkness will allow us to seek specific combo pieces or key cards we need in a moment. These cards are very powerful, but if you play in a meta where chip damage and life total is relevant they should probably be used as a last resort to either lock in your win or stop someone else’s. Almost all of our tutors will be split between those that only find creatures and those that can help us find anything we’d like. Worldly Tutor and Neoform will help us find our creature based win-conditions, but generic tutors can help find those as well. Grim Tutor , Demonic Tutor , and Vampiric Tutor are all going to be awesome for us. We can hunt down any card we need pretty cheaply and efficiently. Cazur is Still Here… Kinda Unlike the more casual version of the deck, Cazur is probably not going to be in play much. He does offer his friend Ukkima certain benefits though, if you know what I mean… Yeah, I’m talking about green ramp. We’ll be stuffing our deck to the gills with mana dorks and other spells to speed up our curve. Bloom Tender and Arbor Elf are often great choices for multi colored decks, as they can generate multiple mana and/or multiple colors of mana. Wall of Roots and Elvish Spirit Guide are great for generating mana quickly and immediately if the need arises. Alternatively, Deathrite Shaman exile key cards from our opponents’ graveyards, potentially even saving a game, when we aren’t using it for mana. For non-creature based mana sources, Carpet of Flowers is still just as good as it was last week. The list of mana artifacts we’ll be running is the same as last week. I’ll be looking more into cool artifacts and artifact focused decks in the future, but for right now I’m not a big enough expert to make any hot takes. To be clear, Cazur isn’t just in the deck to activate our ramp cards. He also turns on some of our powerful interaction spells. Abrupt Decay and Assassin’s Trophy are great removal tools in the deck, that Cazur can brag wouldn’t be around if it weren’t for him. We can also enjoy tilting our friends who play standard with Veil of Summer and it’s slightly less cool cousin Autumn’s Veil . As nice as it is that Cazur is here to hang out, let’s just have another round of applause for Ukkima allowing us to run the powerful counterspells and tech cards in UB. Your Opponents Trying to Win? Just Say No. Counterspells are one of the most powerful tools in magic. “Counter target spell” is up there for the three best words to put on a card. So let’s take a look at some of the best counterspells for the format, the ones you don’t even have to spend mana on! Force of Negation is unbelievably powerful, while hitting the wallet a bit more gently than Force of Will . If you have both, I would absolutely suggest running them in tandem but I’ll be sticking with Negation. Speaking of negation, Pact of Negation is great for winning the game, when there won’t be a next turn. Narset’s Reversal can also help lock in a win by potentially stealing your opponent’s tutor or game winning spell. Even just a slight tax from cards like Miscast , Spell Pierce or Flusterstorm can help stop a lot of wins where your opponent has exact mana. Finally, I just want to offer a quick blurb about some fun (for us, not for our opponents) cards I’ve made room for in this deck. Narset, Parter of Veils is the first card that pops into my head as this girl is rude. Remember Leovold, Emissary of Trest ? This has the same unbelievably cursed effect and dodges creature specific removal. Is your opponent looking for a win out of the yard? Maybe they’re about to resurrect Razaketh the Foulblooded before you’ve even had a turn? Faerie Macabre is here to help you shut that down. One last option I’ve thrown in is Gilded Drake . This is a highly meta-dependent call. I run into a fair amount of hatebears, value generating creatures, and other problematic things that this helps address. There have been some other meta-dependent or potentially budget-busting cards I’ve called out here so there’s a pretty big maybeboard for this deck. Take a look at it and see if there are any cards you think you’d rather include. The full list is below. Full Decklist Alright! That’s all folks! Thanks a ton for reading through this article. I wish you good luck and happy hunting with either of these decks. If you have any commander’s you’d like to see me go over in future articles like this, let me know in the comments or on Hexdrinkers Twitter. Next week I’ll be going over yet another Naya commander, as it is the best color combination… Hold on, I think I hear someone ringing The Hexdrinkers doorbell. Looks like the Azorius Senate. I’ll deal with these schmucks and get back to you as soon as I can. The Top Shelf &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;On the Hunt for Combos (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/the%20top%20shelf/2020/07/16/TTS-WhaleWolf.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;the godfather (brawl)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/07/13/vito_brawl.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/0/f/0fe79ee4-c3f3-4a6b-a967-203ca3b70ee5.jpg?1592761215&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;The Godfather (Brawl)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Enter The Guildhall&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome back for another exciting Brawl deck tech! I know, I know. It’s been a while but I promise between &lt;em&gt;M21&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jumpstart,&lt;/em&gt; the time for Brawl has never been better. With Wizards announcing recently that Brawl will now be available every day for &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; and Historic Brawl seeing a little more attention from the big guys upstairs, we are truly living in a Golden Age. It does bring up the question of will we still be seeing powerful old legends backfilled into the format like we did in the Guildhalls. For now I’m going to revel in the ability to play my favorite format every day!&lt;/p&gt; So, let’s celebrate the only way I know how… brewing a new deck chock full synergy, power, and a dash of ruthlessness. I’m about to make a deck you can’t refuse… My family has finally gotten around to watching the Corleone crime saga and if nothing else is bringing us together in Quarantine, it’s Michael cleaning house of the snitches and hooligans that have tried to have him and his family killed. As Godfather he continues to create a crime empire that spans the country and knows no rivals. That might be a little out of scope for a deck build, but here at Hexdrinkers world domination is never far from our mind…instead we’ll focus on Michael’s inspiration for his long lasting empire! Nothing Al Pacino does would be possible without the foundation laid by his father, Vito. Core Set 2021 Introduced us to Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose and lemme tell ya, I’m impressed. Taking a classic Magic enchantment like Sanguine Bond , throwing it on a stick for two mana less is great. With the right crew, I don’t think it’ll take much to reach Vito’s maximum potential and before long our opponents will be sleeping with the fishes. One for Me, Two For You Ah pinging, the shin-kicks of Magic. Always annoying and not lethal by itself but still capable of inflicting a serious amount of damage. With Vito out, that trouble is doubled. Think of these guys as the street level enforcers. For each life gained, we’ll be dealing more damage directly to our opponents, essentially halving their clock with one of these repeatable engines on the board. Ill-Gotten Inheritance was a draft all star, ending games if you didn’t have an answer. While it’s a little slow for Standard, it fits just perfectly into our Vito shell. Add on the sac ability to potentially deal eight damage to our opponent?? This card should definitely not be taken lightly. Ayara, First of Locthwain joins forces with Syr Konrad, the Grim to just hammer our opponents for any creature entering the battlefield, leaving the battlefield, never reaching the battlefield. No matter what any other creature is doing - it’ll bring the pain to whoever is on the other side of the table. Dread Presence requires a couple land drops, but for the ability to deal two-to-four damage per turn outside of combat, this is not a hard condition to meet. Also, if Vito is currently unavailable - locked in his office listening to the plea of a fishmonger (since no Sicilian can deny a request on his daughter’s wedding day), Dread Presence can be drawing you an extra card per turn Phyrexian Arena style. It’s incredibly versatile. Okay, okay hear me out on Tavern Swindler . In most decks, terrible. In the long run you’ll be gaining just as much life as you’re losing and the odds just aren’t worth it. But, but, in a deck that capitalizes on the mere act of gaining life this card is pretty buckwild. Consider the average of gaining six life every other turn, now consider that with Vito on the board. We’re going to be dealing six damage directly to our opponents on a fairly regular basis without even attacking! Even if it takes us a few turns to start the pain train, this deck sports enough life gain to make the sacrifice worth it. …And of course in some games, you’ll be hitting your opponent for sixevery turn. Editor’s note: This is coming from a guy who runs Okaun, Eye of Chaos and Zndrsplt, Eye of Wisdom in Commander so keep an eye on his coin flipping. Throw in copies of Serrated Scorpion , Bastion of Remembrance , and Sanctum of Stone Fangs for pinging redundancy and I’d be surprised if our opponent can escape ankles un-shanked. The Bosses Pinging is all well and good, but things really start getting scary when we’re gaining lots of life on purpose. Primarily, this means creatures with lifelink swinging in or making use of Vito’s secondary ability. Murderous Rider certainly needs no introduction. As non-conditional creature and planeswalker removal at a decent price, there’s not a black deck that wouldn’t run this card. Throw in the fact that this 2/3 could be dealing four combined damage a turn and it’s all upside. Every self-respecting crime organization needs a hitman. Cavalier of Night is more conditional to activate it’s powerful destroy trigger, but at the end of the day it’s still a 4/5 with lifelink swinging for a potential eight each turn and a recursion ability that can get us back Murderous Rider , Grim Dancer , or even a Vampire of the Dire Moon . The Haunt of Hightower , the often overlooked Buy-A-Box promo for Ravnica Allegiance is a weird, but I assure you this vampire can put in some serious work. If your opponent values their life, they cannot let this live. The Haunt will continue to grow each turn with more and more life gained as your opponent loses all their cards. If nothing else, this card will immediately lure any removal your opponent has out of the woodwork. And ya know…the more I look at it, the more I feel like this card is the nega- Dream Trawler … I don’t think we’d be too far off to include Dreadhorde Invasion and Duskfang Mentor either. While not as flashy as the other lifelinkers, the support is very much appreciated. Obliteration All good things must eventually come to an end, and our games are no exception. After a while, it becomes tiring playing with our opponent’s life total, toying with them, and now it’s time to deal the killing blow. But where do we look for a card that could gain us an obscene amount of life to deal that much damage to our opponents?? I don’t know what Asphodel’s got going on, but it’s straight up scary when Vito comes to town. Our other main win-con is Erebos’s Intervention which trades devotion for paying mana, but we don’t get to hit twice. For consistency, we’ll include a Grim Tutor (which costs a single wild card! Booyah!!), and some other powerful black cards like Massacre Wurm just to cover our bases. 90% of the time, Vito will pull through. The other 10% we throw a giant wurm at ‘em and hope for the best. In Conclusion So there you have it! Whether you want to start your own criminal empire, or just drive your opponents into a rage with every life gained - Vito is your guy. A low cost commander who can enter the board quick and immediately start pulling his weight with the first Radiant Fountain . In an initial run, Vito went 3-2 with losses to Yarok, the Desecrated and a Thassa, Deep-Dwelling / Agent of Treachery soft-lock. Wins against Niv-Mizzet, Reborn , Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy , and Illuna, Apex of Wishes have me feeling pretty confident in the power level of this deck before any fine-tuning. Some things to keep in note though: you always, always want to start with a low-cost lifelinker in your hand. Being able to drop a Boot Nipper or Grimdancer early is vital for success in ramping up the damage by the time your opponent is able to respond. I’d also really consider getting a Grim Tutor if you want to play this deck or anything mono-black in general. The sheer versatility to grab either of our finishers or a removal spell is key, and directly responsible for our Kinnan win by being able to fetch Gray Merchant of Asphodel .

Welcome back to another installment of &lt;em&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/em&gt;, our first for &lt;em&gt;Core 21&lt;/em&gt;. This new core set is an absolute treasure trove for all sorts of formats and playstyles and it contains several enchantments that could become our titular engines. When deciding on what to brew around I considered obvious standouts like &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/m21/28/nine-lives?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/7/e70b7a73-484e-48f1-944c-3d38866cdc20.jpg?1592760676&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Nine Lives &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/m21/142/double-vision?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/7/5/754b77b4-4cc4-4e49-a7a4-667401e7e063.jpg?1592761301&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Double Vision &lt;/a&gt;, or even the Shrine cycle (these aren’t out of the running though, so … stay tuned). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; But ultimately, I decided on a card that no one was talking about. A card that spoke to my simplest and purest form of playstyle: Griffin Aerie . A humble and overlooked uncommon, Griffin Aerie is simple yet efficient in its design and it almost epitomizes what I want to do in Magic. At two mana, it can come down early and isn’t a big investment that sets us back if it quickly gets removed or bounced (cough cough Offspring’s Revenge cough cough). It doesn’t have any activated abilities, just a singular sentence detailing a simple requirement with a simple payoff: you gain three life on your turn, we’ll let you enlist a feathered friend from our aerie. Griffin Aerie isn’t a card that’s over the top, and its condition isn’t insurmountable. It’s fairly easy to trigger just by engaging in combat with lifelink or playing spells that have incidental lifegain, several of which exist in Standard. In return, the payoff is moderate. A 2/2 with flying is pretty good, but it’s nothing ridiculous and it’s hard to truly abuse. Griffin Aerie is a card that sits there and allows you to play like normal and given some deckbuilding considerations will provide a fat stack of advantage over the course of the game. Beautiful. You Only Live Thrice So we already have our rough gameplan: gain at least three life a turn and that will keep us alive while we beat face with an army of eagle-lion-things, more commonly known as griffins. Currently in Standard there are a surprising number of cards that gain us exactly three life. Revitalize , Healer of the Glade , and Ajani, the Greathearted are all options that hit that sweet spot. But what’s even more surprising is how many of these are good. Why settle for these when you could have Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath ? Exactly. Other cards that have seen significant play already include Absorb as a good answer to haymakers or anything with an ETB and Knight of Autumn which has a mode for every situation. We’re comfortably in Bant with these picks and other cards like Elite Guardmage scratch that sweet spot for my value loving brain, but believe it or not, we can also branch in black to find spicier picks. Basilica Bell Haunt, one of the stars of the Offspring’s Revenge article, helps strip our opponent of resources so they can’t defend against our griffin army. If we were playing knights, a Blacklance Paragon (begrudgingly cast during main phase one) is an option. In a mill deck, Creeping Chill would be a star player. Spoiler: we aren’t playing either of those, but they are a route you could go down just to show the versatility of the aerie. Even a personal Eldraine favorite, Clackbridge Troll can trigger our aerie. And if it isn’t, we’re smashing for eight which is just as acceptable. Between the troll and Indulging Patrician , a card perfectly tailored to back up our army of griffins, we’ll be doling out quite the beatdown while brimming with life. Another One As DJ Khaled said, we want another one; another three life, another griffin, all of the above. Since a lot of our lifegain comes in the form of ETBs, this deck is perfect for the host of blink and bounce effects in Standard right now. Thassa, Deep-Dwelling is the go-to for recurring ETBs. Formerly a force of evil who would endlessly trigger Agent of Treachery , she’ll now be blinking our Bell-Haunts and Guardmages to bring us that sweet, sweet value. Her best friend is Charming Prince who already gains us the three life we need right off the bat, but can also help us find our pieces as well as blink something else himself, such as a Guardmage to draw us an additional card. Two more new Core 21 cards to keep the griffin trail rolling are Niambi, Esteemed Speaker and Barrin, Tolarian Archmage . At home alongside Teferi, Time Raveler both in function and lore, these can both bounce our creatures (with upside!) so we can cast them again for maximum griffins. Barrin will get us an additional card if we bounce our own things or he can just as easily give us tempo advantage by bouncing a flying blocker. Niyambi will gain us the life we need if we bounce something, easy griffins. Ten Points to Gryffindor Companion Yorion, Sky Nomad Creatures 3x Barrin, Tolarian Archmage 4x Charming Prince 4x Elite Guardmage 3x Knight of Autumn 3x Niambi, Esteemed Speaker 4x Thassa, Deep-Dwelling 4x Uro, Titan of Nature&#39;s Wrath 2x Yorion, Sky Nomad Enchantments 4x Griffin Aerie Instants 3x Absorb 3x Growth Spiral 2x Lofty Denial 3x Revitalize Planeswalkers 1x Ajani, Great-Hearted 4x Teferi, Time Raveler Lands 4x Breeding Pool 4x Fabled Passage 5x Forest 4x Hallowed Fountain 6x Island 6x Plains 4x Temple Garden This Bant list does a lot of cool things and plays a lot of powerful cards, but during my research I thought I would be remiss if I didn’t give a second take. Black has such a deep pool as we discussed earlier and would provide a different play experience. Plus some of my favorite cards from the research phases are in black and I need to show them some love. This version of the deck relies much less on blinking and bouncing, forgoing that for more grindy cards with more removal and resource denial. I also liked experimenting with more one- and two-of’s to provide consistently new play patterns as well as try out some sweet cards (like Chevill, Bane of Monsters , my co-founder). Slam Dunk in that Aerie, Call Me Blake Griffin Creatures 3x Basilica Bell-Haunt 4x Charming Prince 1x Chevill, Bane of Monsters 3x Clackbridge Troll 1x Elder Gargaroth 4x Indulging Patrician 2x Knight of Autumn 2x Scavenging Ooze Enchantments 2x Dawn of Hope 1x Ethereal Absolution 4x Griffin Aerie Instants 3x Dire Tactics 3x Eliminate 2x Erebos&#39;s Intervention Sorceries 1x Sanguine Indulgence Lands 4x Fabled Passage 2x Forest 4x Godless Shrine 3x Overgrown Tomb 4x Plains 4x Swamp 3x Temple Garden And that wraps up this installment of Rev Your Engines, I hope you’ll be flying high trying this deck out. Remember not to overlook the less flashy cards as often they can be great centerpieces as well and really force you to be creative in deckbuilding.

So we’ve got a bit of a different article set-up for you today. In an effort to promote the differences between our deck-building and theory-crafting, we’ve decided to put together a brand new series called &lt;em&gt;DUEL DECKS&lt;/em&gt;! Basically, we’ll be picking up the slack for Wizards who dropped the classic Duel Decks line a couple years ago with our own crazy builds featuring the best of match-ups. To start things off, we thought we’d jump right into the ridiculously powerful &lt;em&gt;Core Set 2021&lt;/em&gt; that was just released…&lt;/p&gt; You see, we’ve been having a bit of an argument over the superior household animal and I need your help proving him wrong once and for all. That’s right. Chev and his felines are facing off against Julian’s canines: it’s Cats Versus Dogs. Cats Core set 2021 is the redemption cats need after their failed attempt on the silver screen. Between Feline Sovereign and Pridemalkin we’re seeing some absolute stunners represented which is only making the case for kitten superiority stronger. But first, let me introduce you all to someone. He’s been with my family for about half the time of me or my sister, but has already been elevated to favorite child. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s listed first in my parents’ will. What? You dare accuse me of trying to use cute cat photos to convince you that cats are superior? Why that’s, that’s outrageous! I would never! ..Is it working? Cat Kong There are probably two main ways you can take a cat Commander build: Wide ( Jazal Goldmane , Jedit Ojanen of Efrava , Mirri, Weatherlight Duelist ) or Equipment ( Nazahn, Revered Blacksmith , Balan, Wandering Knight , Kemba, Kha Regent ). We’ll be focusing on the wide archetype. Equipment is cool, but I generally prefer to measure fun in CCPM. Or “Cats cast per minute” and the wide strategy has a much stronger CCPM score. So who do we choose to lead our legion of leopards?! Back in 2017, Wizards designed the Commander set around particular tribes of popular Magic creatures. While some of you might be more familiar with Edgar Markov and The Ur-Dragon , This magnificent creature also made quite the appearance: That’s right, a freaking savage, world-roaring CAT! Where were dogs Julian? Probably out sniffing their butts or something. Arahbo ushered in a new era for cat-kind in our favorite casual format by not only being an absolute stud, but also finding ways to provide value wherever our furry friend ends up thanks to eminence. He is exactly what cats need to conquer the multiverse! Muwahahaha… huh? Who said that? Let’s uhh, let’s take a look at the deck! Feline Ferocity Arahbo, Roar of the World always allows us to buff one cat per turn +3/+3, but if he’s on the board, we also can pay {1}{G}{W} for each attacking cat to double its power and toughness. Okay, that’s pretty beast. I mean common household aggro name Xenagos, God of Revels can only double one creature’s stats a turn and he’s a GOD. Point, Arahbo. To best utilize Arahbo’s bounty of beautiful abilities we want to lean heavily on the aggressive nature of our commander and be dropping cats left and right. I want to overwhelm our enemies with cuddly cuteness and claws of steel. Luckily, most cats tend to agree. There are a bajillion ways to generate cat tokens in this deck, these are just the top few. Even better, a lot of the token generation doesn’t even involve tapping, so we can ball out on the attack and still come back with double the number of war-ready cheetahs. (Well, unless you’re poor Pride Sovereign who finds generating tokens so strenuous they have to take two turns off to recover. Taking a nap, drinking some Eternal’s blood, whatever Amonkhet cats do) This allows us to utilize the benefits of Arahbo the most, by giving us as many targets as possible with doubled stats, if we have the mana to back that up. Once we do, this can easily start snowballing. Of course, you might be a little hesitant to spend your mana doubling the power of a legion of 1/1s. Hey I don’t blame yah. Good thing we got lords for DAYZ. Be they true feline or leonin, cats have been getting buffed since the early 2000s. Dogs…I mean, they got Pack Leader …which is cute and oh so fluffy, but here’s areminder of what the cats are working with? Just get one of these bad boys on the field and we’re already talking about our 1/1 tokens becoming 4/4s with Arahbo’s boost. Not to mention the glorious inclusion of Beastmaster Ascension , Mirari’s Wake , Overwhelming Stampede , and True Conviction to add even more base power. We’re all about redundancy. Just imagine an army of these absolute chonks coming at ya. You’d run. I’d run. And we all know a dog would run. Aide-de-Camp We’ve also got a friend from Ikoria who serves as Arahbo’s right-hand cat in the war against canines, Kaheera, the Orphanguard . Kaheera provides support as another lord for our army, and a giver of vigilance, a fantastic buff allowing us both offense and defense. Taking advantage of the absolutely bonkers way the companion mechanic is integrating with Commander, i.e. allowing us a 101st card, this allows Kaheera to be an essential 9th card in our starting hand meaning instant lord access. Yes, the companion change means I need to drum up 3 mana first to get Kaheera into my hand but she’s still suuuper powerful. And we’re in green so like, nbd. Insult to Injury Sometimes, buff cats just aren’t enough. Even with a powerful second-in-command and Arahbo dropping buffs like a cleric, we might need to call in a helping hand. We need something like… Which also just got reprinted! Just to be safe, we also have Mirror Entity waiting in the wings to provide a party buff, and more individual tactical advantages like Berserk and Hunter’s Prowess if we need to deliver the death strike with a single Serpopard. Psssst You know this last one might not even be fair. I can’t in good conscience give you this strat. Dogs probably haven’t deserved this absolute obliteration… …so I’ll tell you, whatever you do, do not add Nine Lives and Solemnity to your build. And especially no tutors like idyllic Tutor or Enlightened tutor . That would, that would be terrible. Sure, all dogs might go to heaven - but cats can live forever (with the right enchantment). Cats Cats Cats Decklist Dogs The domesticated portion of the canine family tree that we know as dogs have been called many things; fluffers, floofers,woofers, puppies, doggos, good boys and girls, just to name a few. But never have they been called hounds. This was a mistake that Magic had been making since the game’s inception (minus Zodiac Dog, Portal was weird). But the release of Core 2021 and Jumpstart we have been given a blessing in the errata of the hound creature type to dog. And with this change, Wizards has started to give doggos the love that they deserve in the form of true tribal support, something that those wretched cats have been receiving en masse for the past few years . And most of the cat tribal support until just recently derives from lion men being a thing in Magic for forever, which I think is a little unfair. I believe dogs and wolves (both the were and non-were varieties) should be able to run in the same pack, but alas. As a proud dog owner and lover since I was born, it’s only natural that I remind the world who the best pets are with a dog-themed Commander deck! And also I want to put Chev in his place… A Bite to Back Up the Bark Dogs come in all different breeds, and despite there only being a measly 89 dogs printed in the game’s nearly 30 year history, they can be found in all 5 colors! Since dogs have been printed so sparingly, Wizards hasn’t had time to really find the sweet spot on canine design. I’m not gonna sugarcoat it: most of these cards aren’t… competitive. However, there are a few floofers that I want to draw attention to. The best and newest is Pack Leader . The only dog lord, he is absolutely essential for our pack to succeed. Also from Core 21 is Selfless Savior . Many people have said that they would die for their dog, but this little pup is willing to put himself on the line for our cause. Being able to protect our Pack Leader or another crucial canine is a godsend. Hailing from Tarkir and bringing back memories of our foundational Magic days are Ainok Guide and Ainok Survivalist . The former helps fix our five color mana base and the latter, along with newcomer Rambunctious Mutt , is great at picking off an opposing Coat of Arms or Mirari’s Wake (that’s right Chev, I see the shenanigans you’re up to playing real cards). Two more powerful and more ferocious options are Underworld Cerberus and his counterpart Kunoros, Hound of Athreos . When people have signs that read “Beware of Guard Dog,” they’re talking about these guys. No one is getting close to their graveyards when these guys are around. Man’s Best Friend Now, if the puppers were just going at it alone, it would be a rough time. But, luckily, dogs aren’t known as ‘Man’s Best Friend’ for nothing. We’ve got a whole team of breeders, walkers, trainers, etc in tow to support these furballs! First up is Alpine Houndmaster . A new addition, this guy brings along his two best buddies right to our hand for some sick card advantage. Speaking of card advantage, Den Protector , Archaeomancer , and Snapcaster Mage all make sure that we continually have toys for our dogs to play with, while Gerrard, Weatherlight Hero makes sure that we continually have doggos to play with our toys Lastly we have Drannith Magistrate and Containment Priest to make sure that those tricksy cats (or reanimation players) can’t cheat us. Two for One Now, we are bringing a few more creatures who are simultaneously Man and Best Friend: changelings. There’s a running joke that Chameleon Colossus is the best insert tribe here and it’s no different for dogs. Our changelings are generally powerful and also receive all the bonuses for being a dog while also being a human. Irregular Cohort , Taurean Mauler , and Graveshifter are all welcome additions to the pack. Which now leads us to the elephant (dog? changeling?) in the room. “Julian”, I rhetorically say to myself alone in my room in a voice meant to mimic you readers, “This is a Commander deck, who’s our general?” To which I say, “I have some unfortunate news kids.” There is no* dog commander. Kunoros and Isamaru, Hound of Konda are legendary dogs, but they don’t provide the color depth needed to shelter our strays. Rin and Seri, Inseparable while an interesting card in design space is absolute heresy when we’re here to show the cats that dogs are superior. We cannot have a cat in power. And thus we turn to technicalities. Morophon, the Boundless has helmed many an under-supported tribal deck and they’ll do the same for us. Providing us mana cost reductions while also buffing our dogs (or humans, depending on our board at the time we cast him) will secure him a spot as the pack alpha. Throw a Dog a … If there’s one thing that dogs love to do, it’s play! Cats are lame. They just sit around, do their own thing, and only seek human attention when it’s dinner time. Dogs want love, affection, and for their owner to stop playing arena and go outside to throw a bone or ball. (Of course since this is a war against the feline menace, we generally will be playing with sharper and pointier toys, but we do have a few balls to toss.) Mirari and it’s Wake are both important for us. Fixing and accelerating is crucial in a five color deck and being able to copy things like Swords to Plowshares or even an Eladamri’s Call can get us out of hairy situations. Sword of Fire and Ice and Sword of Feast and Famine (among others, we’re playing five swords), aren’t exactly a T-bone for our pups to gnaw on, but they will sure help us hold back the cat crusade. And of course we also have to suit up our doggos with some Lightning Greaves and Swiftfoot Boots so they can chase Arahbo and Brimaz out of town. And of course, at the end of the day, we’ll be flying our Vanquisher’s Banner , or more likely using it to wipe the mud and blood off our dogs’ feet. Can’t have them tracking it through the house. It’s a Dog Eat Dog World It’s ruff out there, especially for dogs in Magic. But these most recent sets are looking like they might teach the old dogs some new tricks. This deck is not exactly powerful, but it’s fun and on theme! We’re running tutors and good removal to shore up our lack of powerhouse dogs. Soon enough though, we’ll have enough tribal support for a real deck that can go toe to toe with the tribal giants like Elves and Merfolk. (Also to provide a contingency we are running the Academy Rector , Kaervek’s Spite , Barren Glory combo which is not one you see, like… ever. Figured we could mix things up, especially if Chev is talking about Solemnity shenanigans, that degenerate.) Doggos Go! Decklist So, there you have it! Two fantastic new tribal decks featuring some of Magic’s goodest boys, and fantastic felines. Which side will you chose? Duel Decks &lt;p&gt;Commander&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tribal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cats Versus Dogs (Commander)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/duel%20decks/2020/07/10/dd1_catvdogs.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;only the luckiest of clovers (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/on%20the%20rocks/2020/07/06/otr4_naya_adventures.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/7/c/7c5d0560-f9e6-4c70-8cce-cae61e4e74bc.jpg?1572490518&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Only The Luckiest of Clovers (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;On the Rocks&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome back one and all to the fourth installment of &lt;em&gt;On the Rocks&lt;/em&gt;! Jund Food was so much fun last time and piloting it reminded me of the power, but also the fun play patterns, of &lt;em&gt;Throne of Eldraine&lt;/em&gt; cards (yes yes, I know there are some who would beg to differ).&lt;/p&gt; With that on the mind, I decided to virtually sleeve up an Adventure deck, but not one that’s been in the limelight. This time we’re playing Naya Adventures! I love the Lucky Clover / Edgewall Innkeeper core and I figured we should give some love to the lesser used adventure cards.

I’m Eric and I’ll be your guide for most of this series. I am being brought on to add a new voice and additional perspectives to &lt;em&gt;Hexdrinkers&lt;/em&gt;. You can read more about me and find other articles by me on my author page here (https://hexdrinkers.com/authors/eric.html)! &lt;em&gt;The Top Shelf&lt;/em&gt; is a new series, focusing on unique commanders that have exciting potential in both competitive and casual magic. There are a lot of commanders that fall into this category but we’ll start with one that I have been interested in for a long time: &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/c19/38/atla-palani-nest-tender?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/f/6/f6aa473b-85cd-431d-844b-218368fe955e.jpg?1568003640&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Atla Palani, Nest Tender &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Her ability initially makes you wonder what ‘Eggs ‘are there in Magic and how good are they? Don’t let the eggs fool you though, for the competitive build we’re looking at today the real eggs aren’t eggs at all. Instead they are Changelings! Creature’s with the Changeling ability count as eggs, which is just fine for our purpose. Atla was originally a secondary commander in C19. The base deck was designed to continuously create and copy tokens. Jumping off from that point would typically make you think of creatures that make tokens or a large battlecruiser deck that cheats some mana through sacrificing eggs. We’ll even be going into one of those later in this article. But for now, we’re going to look at Atla as a combo focused commander. I’m not Even Yolking, It Works Atla has a bespoke combo that works with her triggered ability. It requires us to run the following cards: Mirror Entity , a card that does damage when it enters or leaves the battlefield, and a card which can shuffle our graveyard back in when it dies. Additionally, Atla needs to have either a temporary stat bonus for the turn or a +1/+1 counter. The good news is that we only need Atla, Mirror Entity , and the buff in play to actually start the combo. The rest can be in our deck, our graveyard, or even exiled from the game. Let’s step through the combo now to just get a base example of how it works. With both Atla Palani, Nest Tender and Mirror Entity on the field, give Atla at least +1/+1 then activate Mirror Entity ’s ability for zero mana an arbitrarily large number of times. This will set the toughness of all your creatures to zero and makes them all eggs, but Atla will survive due to the buffs we just gave her. Mirror Entity will die and cause the next creature in your deck to flip onto the field. It too will be an egg with zero toughness, so it’ll die and rotate out as well. This repeats until we run out of creatures. We can loop this process by shuffling our graveyard back into the deck with a card like Kozilek, Butcher of Truth . Finally, Goblin Arsonist will eventually kill all our opponents by pinging them each time it leaves the battlefield. Protecting Our Nest Eggs Most competitive EDH metas are rife with stax and other defensive tools to prevent combo wins like ours. So, included in this deck are a variety of creatures who will help remove those obstructions as we cycle through with the Atla combo. Goblin Sharpshooter can kill any creature without Hexproof and Manglehorn can do the same for artifacts. We’re even running Caustic Caterpillar to get around things that shut off enter the battlefield effects. Riftsweeper can recover any of our helpful creatures that have been exiled, offering us some protection against even instant speed graveyard hate. So if you’re feeling bold you can try to combo off in the face of almost any defensive setup and just see if the heart of the cards is on your side. These creatures will do a lot of work toward protecting us after we’ve entered the loop, but we’ll need some protection beforehand as well. Naya doesn’t have a very wide selection of cards that fall into that category. However, we can still find some powerful cards among them, see Pyroblast and Red Elemental Blast . Additionally, bask in the groans of the table every time you get to cast Veil of Summer and Autumn’s Veil . Naya Can’t Combo… Unless? Competitive decks can struggle if they only have one route to victory. So, in order to avoid those issues we’re going to run a suite of other typical combos that fall into our colors. The first ones that come to mind for most are the variations involving Kiki Jiki, Mirror Breaker . We’re going to be running multiple cards that allow for different infinites with Kiki as well as Splinter Twin to add consistency. Offense isn’t going to be enough to get us across the line though. On the scale of cEDH decks, we don’t expect to keep up with Tier 0 decks, but we do need to be able to stop some decks faster than ours. In order to do this we’ll be running a light stax package to compete with those strategies. But not to worry, we won’t hurt our own game plan too much. Root Maze and Kataki, War’s Wage have always stood out to me as solid cards for the format given the omnipresence of artifacts. Both Thalia, Heretic Cathar and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben will also give us a chance to pump the brakes on other common strategies. A few of our other powerhouse defensive cards are shown below. Easter Egg Hunt Now, for the final question: How are we going to find and play all these cards we just talked about? To play our main combo in one turn is a minimum of eight mana, including four colored mana (WWRG). In order to find all our pieces and have the mana to play them, ramp and tutors are going to be key. We run an interesting mix of ramp packages to make sure that our hate cards (and those of our opponents) don’t end up hitting us too hard. Mana dorks, such as Birds of Paradise , Bloom Tender , and Arbor Elf are always good to have around, so we’ll toss a few of those in. Artifact ramp is a staple in cEDH if only due to its raw power. So including cards like Mana Vault and Sol Ring can help us accelerate to key turns when it really matters. Finally, by rounding out with a few choice enchantments, shown below, we end up with a very strong looking ramp package. Of course, draw engines such as Sylvan Library will always have their place, but we want to go even faster. So instead we’re looking for direct tutors such as Altar of Bone and Sylvan Tutor . Some of our alternate win conditions require us to find enchantments so we’ll be running Enlightened Tutor and Academy Rector as well. Most of our wins require specific creatures though, which green does a fantastic job of tutoring for with cards like Chord of Calling and Finale of Devastation . We run a lot of tutors so I won’t go into all of them, but a few more of our choice selection are shown below: Well, that is all on our competitive deck. With this guide on the build you can feel free to make your own meta dependent switches. In the sideboard of the deck I call out a few helpful cards that can be subbed in depending on budget and meta. Even if your first few matches end up being a bit scrambled or hard boiled, I’m sure you’ll be winning matches over easy in no time! (I’m not even close to sorry about the egg puns). Full Decklist All Our Eggs In One Basket Let’s take a step back now that we’ve finished one of our decks. We originally said this commander would be great for a less competitive build focused on eggs, tokens, and the sweet sweet taste of battlecruiser magic. Well, I’m excited to let you know that’s exactly what we’re talking about next. This build is going to run you under $200 and should fit in a more casual and/or combat focused meta. Atla Palani, Nest Tender will still be front and center, but we still have one lurking question about this deck… How many eggs are we allowed to run? Dragon Egg was printed not too long ago, so surely there should be plenty in magic’s long history, right? And that’s it! All the Naya eggs. Wait, that’s it? Frantically checking notes. That can’t be it, right? How are we going to make this deck work with four eggs? Well, we’re going to have to rely on Atla’s slightly underwhelming activated ability for the most part. But, we still have some good news coming! Nesting Dragon is able to crank out at least an egg a turn while we’re hitting our land drops. Additionally, there are a few changelings that we can run to fill in our empty nest. (PSA, do not try to activate Mirror Entity’s ability for 0 in this deck. You will not enjoy the results.) What if we clone our eggs?. Atla and Nesting Dragon both make egg tokens, so populating and doubling tokens can be very powerful for us… Of course a lot of token doublers would bust our budget pretty hard, but Second Harvest is a great fit and Growing Ranks is a good example of a repeated populate effect. We’re also going to be on the lookout for cards that give us other benefits in addition to copying our eggs, such as the following cards: Loot Boxes, In My Card Game? Well, now it’s time to hatch those eggs and find out just what is inside! In order to cycle through these eggs fast enough to see our powerful cards, we’re going to need some sacrifice outlets or ways to crack these eggs. In Naya we don’t have a ton of options, but they definitely exist. For example, Greater Gargadon and Dragon Broodmother allow us to add more top end to our deck and start off our sacrifice package right. Martyr’s Cause offers us a good defensive option and can set up a strong counter punch. Switching out one of our eggs for a beefy blocker can seriously disrupt our opponent’s plans. I also want to offer a specific call out for Slaughter the Strong which allows us to sacrifice all our eggs, keep Atla on the field, and clear the way for all the creatures about to hatch. Artifacts are going to let us fill out the rest of this package. We’re going to be running a pretty tight selection of creatures so that every time we crack an egg we either get another egg or a powerful creature. Enter the battlefield triggers will really help exaggerate the effects we get from cheating mana. Combustible Gearhulk and Ravager Wurm are both cards that immediately present a strong board presence and give us an upside when they come into play. Angel of Serenity and Terastodon also fall into this category as well. They help us keep the board clear as we’re hatching these massive creatures. Naya is also a home to creatures that are incredibly powerful when they get to sit on the field. Vigor is a pet card of mine that I think will do great work for us. It manages to simultaneously discourage people from attacking us or blocking our creatures. Aurelia, the Warleader is arguably one of the most powerful cards we get to include. Multiple combat steps can allow for massive and unexpected swing turns. Green Eggs and Ramp I think there’s some bad news coming though… We may not always get to turn a bunch of eggs into massive creatures at little to no cost. We may at some point need to start paying for these monsters, so mana ramp is going to be a prominent feature of our deck. Unfortunately we don’t get to use mana dorks because seeing one come out of an egg may actually break my heart. Let’s start with the land ramp. Explosive Vegetation and Rampant Growth are obvious classics for a ramp package. But, I’m here to offer the deep cuts, the B sides, of ramp. So let’s talk about Spoils of Victory and Collective Voyage . These cards are going to help us fetch stronger lands and more lands respectively. On the topic of getting more than one land, Khalni Heart Expedition and Tempt with Discovery can be very powerful as well (Never get tempted by someone else by the way). Lands aren’t the only way to ramp though, artifact ramp is in some ways even more powerful, but with its own weaknesses. The signets are a great way to start off at this power level, so let’s toss in the full set. Sol Ring is one of the best cards in this category and should be pretty easy to get your hands on. Commander’s Sphere and Fellwar Stone are also going to do great things for us in terms of mana fixing. Well, that concludes my analysis on this version of the deck. I tried to keep this to a budget that made sense to me, but I remember hating spending money on lands when I could get some game winning eight-drops for the same price. I’ve offered some higher end suggestions in the maybe board of the deck list. Feel free to make any substitutions you’d like though! This is a deck that can be driven in pretty much any direction. Tribal and Token themes could be more pronounced if that appealed to you. If you have any commanders you’d like to see me do an analysis of like this or any thoughts on the series feel free to let us know on Twitter or in the comments below!

They claim no one else even wanted to interview them…preposterous. Here is our unedited question section from that interview. Enjoy:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Q: Wow, THE Julian Leal and Chev Eldrid? It’s so good to finally meet you! I’ve been following you guys ever since that welcome article and continue to come back two times a week! JL: …Chev, what’s going on? Aren’t you the one writing this? CE: What? No, this is a very unbiased reporter who is also a big fan of ours. I’m just happy we could make the time for them. Please, continue. Q: Thank you Chev. Now we’ve known Hexdrinkers as a brand first, and its people second. Obviously Julian is the one responsible for classics like the “On The Rocks” series and Chev has really taken to the MTGA Brawl format, but aside from the writing we don’t know much about you both. JL: Yes we’re very private people. That’s why we like to keep our Twitter account as a single follower and keep our site relatively unlisted on Google. It’s what has helped us really cultivate our “elusive” persona. Q: That can’t possibly be on purpose. CE: …psh yeah it totally is, shut up. Q: Anyway, I’ve gathered a set of questions that I hope will shed some more light on who you two are, your favorite experiences with magic, and what makes you two unique in the world of mtg content producers. So with that I’d love to get started? JL: Perfect! Question 1: You both joined the game in the Khans block, right? What would you say has been your favorite standard set since joining in 2015? JL: It has to be what we started with: Dragons of Tarkir. So many interesting and flashy cards, especially the Dragon Lords. That’s how our LGS tempted us into trying Magic out. I’ve always loved 3-color decks since then and the abundance of legendaries helped us transition nicely into Commander. That was like the wild west back then, but it was super fun, figuring out how to actually play and trying out innocent fun brews before we knew anything about ‘tiers’ and ‘metas’. It’s that sort of style that we want to emulate and recreate. CE: I think I’d have to go with Dominaria. For me, even though the full history of Dominaria didn’t resonate with me as well as more enfranchised players, I still recognized a lot of the characters like Jhoira Weatherlight Captain and Karn, Scion of Urza . Dominaria was also the height of my paper involvement in the game thanks to a really welcoming FNM community when I was studying in New Zealand and the incredible amount of Brawl I played with Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive . 10/10 Would do it again. Question 2: Starting from one base color, what color combinations do you most resonate with up through the shards/wedges? JL: Blue for me. Yup, I’m that guy in our playgroup, despite not playing that many counterspells. I’ve always been a Johnny, and being able to play at instant speed, ready to react to any situation as well as creatively set up awesome plays and win-cons is exactly where I want to be. My first decks were prowess decks with big flyers and then transitioned into Simic value in Commander. Secondarily, it’s a toss-up between black and white, but I have to go with white, making me Azorius. White has everything I want in a support color as a control player. Powerful removal, excellent sideboard cards, and a few big flashy fliers to close out the game (I had a notorious angel deck in the early days of our playgroup). CE: Ask him why it was notorious, the answer may surprise you. JL: …Lastly, my shard identity would be Esper. My longest standing commander deck is Dakkon Blackblade control and my first “favorite” deck was Esper Dragons from Standard during Khans block and Origins. The combination of being able to deal with any permanent that hits the battlefield and the card advantage of blue and black is right where I want to be. Plus it includes some of my all time favorite cards Vindicate , Utter End (another love from Khans Block), and Anguished Unmaking . That being said, I’ve found homes in all colors and am actively working to move outside my comfort zone in all formats….. But if I had my way, I’d play Esper Control whenever I could. CE: While I initially leaned green, thanks to an absolutely bonkers Elf duel deck…I’ve definitely shifted more towards black in recent years as a primary color. I really like the idea of success at any cost. Sacrificing your own creatures or using your own life as a resource to get ahead. That philosophy actually inspired the Selenia, Dark Angel Commander deck I’ve had for years and still love piloting: take yourself down to near zero life just to swap with someone else. It’s all about using your own stability to take others down with you. I pick green back up in the two color identity, always having been a big fan of the Golgari utilizing that black theme and adding the warped growth of green when paired with black. This is especially true when looking at my Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons commander deck. Inflicting those -1/-1s upon myself and my armies to slowly wither you down with deathtouch snakes. It’s a riot! Lastly, I would say that Abzan is my three-color. I have the least amount of attachment to this identity but it was my first theme deck purchase with Ivorytusk Fortress back in Khans, and I continue to find myself scheming with Abzan commanders…even if none ever get assembled. Question 3: Is there any particular card in the game that you have particularly strong memories of? Good or bad. JL: Mirrorwing Dragon from Eldritch Moon. That card is sweeeeeet. It was the centerpiece of the first Standard deck that I brewed and fully built to play at FNM. The deck consisted of a bunch of good rate creatures and efficient pump spells so you could target the dragon and buff your whole team like crazy and swing out. The deck did reasonably well, was a lot of fun to play, and was a big personal victory for my deck-building infancy. CE: Oh, easily Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger . One of the first mythic rares I pulled and just the raw power emanating from that card…woof. It quickly became the centerpiece of an EDH deck that lives on today under Kozilek, the Great Distortion but has also fallen under Kruphix, God of Horizons and Animar, Soul of Elements . Eldrazi Tribal deck has always been one of my favorites, and I’m really hoping for some new tech in the fall Zendikar set. But yeah, Ulamog started it all. Question 4: If you had to forge a life somewhere in the multiverse, what plane would you most want to find yourself on? JL: Shandalar. It’s a “rogue plane,” it drifts through the Multiverse doing it’s own thing and not much is known about that. I like that sort of vibe and I like the peaceful and serene lifestyle of being off the beaten path, communing with nature, etc. Also, it’s super mana rich and all the artwork from there looks gorgeous, so it’d be great for someone who likes to be outside like myself. CE: I think…Kaladesh. Post Aether Revolt. Just an absolutely beautiful aesthetic that was brought to life in one of Magic storytellings more successful runs. As a software developer, I love the idea of a plane with technology built into its very core and as a set it introduced so many cool new cards and ideas (including a bunch of bannings but hey, Live Fast Die Young ). Question 5: What excites you most currently about Magic as a whole? JL: The breadth of ways to play. In the beginning we just lumped whatever cards we had together and fought it out in our basements. Then we jumped into Commander, later on started drafting, and now I’m playing competitively in Standard on Arena. We dabbled in other formats, but there’s still so many ways to play Magic that I want to experience and become knowledgeable about. CE: Currently? I’d say the depth. As we’re trying to start this website with our own ideas and views - we’re constantly discovering new strategies or archetypes that we can really sink our teeth into without stepping on too many toes. There’s always more to discover and explore. Question 6: So, we all know the Player Archetypes of Magic, but which do you think most resonate with you? JL: I said this earlier, but definitely Johnny. CE: Johnny, with a side of Vorthos. Julian will be the first to tell you of my propensity to play “bad cards” because I feel they either fall on-theme or I think they have more potential than they really do. Just ask him about Eternal Scourge and Ice Cauldron in my Eldrazi deck… JL: … I don’t wanna talk about those cards. Q: Wow! Well, I think that’s all we have time for today. Thank you so much for your time! I have to be off but I hope to see you both again soon! JL: WAIT! YOU CAN’T LEAVE ME ALONE WITH HIM HE- Meta &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A Casual Sitdown with the Founders&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/meta/2020/06/29/author_faq.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;you feelin’ hungry, punk?

Recently resurfacing with the recent bannings and rules change, has it returned to its former glory (the answer is not quite, but it’s still good).

Can’t be as bad as the Origins boxes Julian and I opened a little over 5 years ago…can it?&lt;/p&gt; Over these next couple weeks before release, we at Hexdrinkers thought we’d focus on some of the new cards joining us this summer. One of which has also inspired the first mono-red commander deck I’ve ever put together. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FORRRRR SUBIRA, TULZIDI CARAVANNER! She’s got haste, she’s got the ability to make our mini-minions unblockable, AND has a pretty handy take on red card draw. Get it? Handy? Ahhh I wonder if Julian will let that through editing EDITOR’S NOTE: (I did, I am sorry - Julian). Let’s take Subira’s textbox line-by-line while we start to form some ideas on how to build a deck that most accurately shows off this new legend’s power. Break it Down Haste Okay maybe we don’t need to spend so much time on this one BUT it does help highlight the aggressive nature of this no-nonsense caravan leader. You know we’ll be swinging on turn 3 at whoever still doesn’t have a creature out. There’s always one. {1}: Another target creature with power 2 or less can’t be blocked this turn. This is probably going to be the most important line on the entire card. Subira wants as many small creatures attacking as possible, but we’ll need the mana to pay for it. This seems like a less conditional, but more restrictive version of another Jamuraa legend we saw in C16, Sidar Kondo of Jamuraa . While that version doesn’t require an activation cost, I don’t think Sidar Kondo is nearly as powerful as Subira, and we’ll get to why in a minute. I also want to point out that Subira’s ability says another target creature can’t be blocked. So no shenanigans with a self-target and pumping for commander damage. {1}{R}, {T}, Discard Your Hand: Until end of turn, whenever a creature you control with power 2 or less deals combat damage to a player, draw a card. Ooooo boy. Okay. This whole “whenever a creature deals combat damage, draw a card” is not an ability we generally see in red. Like, at all. From a couple informed Scryfall searches I couldn’t find a single example of this ability being used outside of blue and green with cards like Bident of Thassa and Keeper of Fables . This is a big deal. Yes, the creatures have to have power two or less - but considering that’s the same condition for unblockability it reinforces the cornerstones of our deck. No concerns here. The only downside of course is discarding your whole hand…but I don’t think it’ll be as big a deal as we might think. We can also capitalize on it with cards like Glint-Horn Buccaneer and Brallin, Skyshark Rider . Bottomline, when combined with the above ability to make all our creatures unblockable, we’ll be drawing an obscene amount of cards in a color that generally struggles to do so. Take that Sidar Kondo. So we’ve got a commander that can push through damage AND draw us cards at a consistent rate, we just need to do it on her terms. Meaning we need an army of creatures that are power two or less. In Red. I wonder where we’re going to find them… Down, down to Goblin Town That’s right, it’s a caravan of goblins and Subira is leading them on a quest to pillage and loot until your opponents are crying for mercy. Goblins are by nature very low to the ground and annoying little punks which is exactly what we’re looking for. Whether it be through token generation, goblin tutors (which there are a surprising amount of), or just a lot of creatures, we’ll be filling the board quickly and effectively. Bring on the Goblins Focusing first on the incredible rate at which Goblins produce more goblins, it’s no surprise that most other goblin commanders are potent token generators. Krenko has a long history of bringing an overwhelming force of rage every turn, and while Pashalik is a newer addition to the scene - he’s just as ready to keep cranking out 1/1s. We’ve also got cards like Beetleback Chief and Empty the Warrens when Krenko or Pashalik can’t pull all the weight on their own. Our other main method of getting goblins into play is by tutoring and cheating them onto the battlefield. I’ll be honest, I did not expect this subtheme to be available, color me pleasantly surprised. Gosh darn it, these little goblin buggers are starting to earn my respect! Between Goblin Matron , Warren Instigator , and Goblin Lackey no matter what goblin we need - whether it be token generators or a tribal payoff - they’ll all be close at hand. Ankle Shanking So now we’ve got a board full of goblins, what do we do with them? Krenko and Pashalik brought all their friends to the party, but it’s Subira’s job to keep them entertained. Between Subira’s first ability, Purphoros, God of the Forge , Cavalcade of Calamity , and Boggart Shenanigans it doesn’t matter what our goblins are doing - our opponents will be feeling the pain. Goblin enters the battlefield, Purphoros and Impact tremors lay on the heat. Goblin attacks, get ready for Cavalcade of Calamity, and Raid Bombardment . Goblin dies, Boggart Shenanigans makes sure we have the last laugh. And When all that’s not enough, Gratuitous Violence and Fiery Emancipation raise the red pain train up to 11, turning even the minor-est of pings into a full blown smack. We’ve also got the Standard champ Torbran, Thane of Red Fell joining in on the fun! Now, I’m not a big math guy but if I do some calculations, carry the two, multiply by three… I think we’re looking at a metric %$@#-ton of damage per goblin. Draw, Go Once in a while we’ll feel like our hand is somewhat in need of a refresher, and Subira will need to make use of that secondary ability, giving us a whole lotta extra ammunition from our army of critters. We will need to spend two mana on the draw ability, so make sure you factor that into your unblockable mana-dump calculations. That is of course unless you’ve got a Battle Hymn or Brightstone Ritual in hand…then all bets are off. We’re also running Glint-Horn Buccaneer to take full advantage of the discard effect present on both Subira and cards like Faithless Looting . Even our “drawing” will hurt our opponents! Mwuahahaha! The Team Players Like any incredibly sinister plan to poke our opponents to death, this wouldn’t be possible without the hard work of plenty of other cards keeping our goblins happy, healthy, and unblocked. Give it up for the best of the rest! Helping Subira make the most of those many mini attacks we’ve got Kamigawa’s own Akki Underminer . A 1/1 goblin who makes our opponent sacrifice a permanent anytime it deals combat damage! Who designed this guy?! Don’t care, it’s a beast and I love it. Throne of the God-Pharaoh deals one extra helping of butt-whooping with each turn our goblin army attacks, and Shared Animosity triggers after we’d make creatures unblockable so we get an actual massive amount of damage through with just a few goblins! We’ve also got Meekstone , Red Elemental Blast , Deflecting Swat , and more keeping our board and commander safe from any sort of interaction from our pesky opponents. Lastly, the cleanup step. If our endless damage locomotive of goblins isn’t enough for an unparalleled victory we’ve got a couple extra tricks up our sleeve. Like any good red deck, we’ve got Insurrection as a solid Plan B and Price of Progress in the Plan C position to hopefully take everyone down at least ten life for daring to play multicolor decks. I mean, the nerve! And if all that doesn’t work. Well. Clearly a couple of your goblins must have stepped on their own mines like their buddy Goblin Kaboomist . Can’t be helped when dealing with the lil’ numskulls… I think that about wraps up how much I’m willing to say before giving you all the decklist but rest assured there are plenty of surprises left in store should you take this puppy for a drive! Enjoy everything Subira has to offer with her Goblin Caravan and stick around for more sick M21 builds!!

Whether you’re John Wick, the oblivious half of a rom-com couple, or perhaps the greatest comeback champ of all time: Taylor Swift.&lt;/p&gt; Love Story In our last Brawl Homebrew (found here), we explored the potential of an absolute blast from the past, Hanna, Ships Navigator , the Brawl Guildhall legend of the month. For me, it was love at first sight. Fresh off building an incredible Selesnya Auras deck championed by Siona, Captain of the Pyleas , I felt the switch to Azorius for similar Enchanted shenanigans would be relatively simple. Recursion of our Elspeth Conquers Death and Kiora Bests the Sea God seemed too good to pass up! But as we soon discovered, Magic has come a long way since Invasion and what was once an absolutely incredible ability comes in just too little too late 9 times out of 10. Legends like Yarok, the Desecrated or Snapdax, Apex of the Hunt continued to have the drop on our build making Hanna feel a bit like a liability. While we didn’t lose those games, they were always incredibly close. In fact our only loss was to… Another enchantment and artifact commander, except this one has an extra slew of keywords and doesn’t need to be tapped. It was a bloodbath. Alela and her flock (is a grouping of faeries called a flock? A mischief?) dive-bombed poor Hanna until there was nothing left. Absolute tragedy. But I know this is not the end Taylor Swift would approve of. No, if she were here she’d say to be Fearless, because in the wise words of the rocker herself, “Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want all over again… even though every time you’ve tried before, you’ve lost.” I can’t let T Swift down. Maybe Hanna just isn’t the right call for enchantments/artifacts in Brawl right now. Perhaps we’ll get more powerful artifact support down the line that will help her become an absolute powerhouse but for now, I need to look elsewhere if I want to succeed with an artifact and enchantment focused build. Maybe to Hanna’s greatest nemesis in the Brawl Guildhall. Look What You Made Me Do That’s right. It’s time to put on our war paint, get our act together, and bring the fight back to Alela. You know what that means: We’re going to build our own version of the legendary pushed-for-brawl faerie, but better, and it’s going to be absolutely awesome! The disappointing days of dropping enchantments and having to wait for them to leave the battlefield to get value from our commander are gone. As soon as Alela hits the field we’ll be filling it with a Mischief (I’ve decided that’s cooler sounding than a flock) of Faeries that don’t know the word “mercy”. Probably the biggest change to our deck is going to be a flyer subtheme. While Alela creates 1/1 flyers with every enchantment and artifact cast, she also gives all flyers +1/+0 because Alela takes no prisoners…and needed to sell pre-constructed Brawl decks. Divine Visitation is an absolute must for any token theme, trading all our meager 1/1s in for 4/4 Angels, ready to rain down holy hellfire on all those doubters. “In a relationship each person should support the other; they should lift each other up.” Alela provides Divine Visitation with an endless supply of tokens and Visitation makes them the angels they are. It’s a match made in heaven. Winged Words provides draw at an amazing rate with any flyers on the field, and Luminous Broodmoth makes sure any of our wingless support gets their chance in the sky. We’ll also be taking advantage of Archon of Sun’s Grace for even more flying tokens and enchantment synergy, as well as Ethereal Absolution to…okay I’m assuming you’re getting the idea by now. We’re going to have sooo many flyers, it’ll be great. Enchanted Since this deck was initially a derivation of our Hanna deck, there might be some redundancy in this cardpool but we’ll pick out some specific all-stars for the highlights. Most of our enchantments are still sitting squarely in Azorius, with Mire’s Grasp as our only mono-black one, but that’s to be expected. Elspeth Conquering death is quite a saga, and with that first turn being able to permanently exile someone’s commander or any real threat is truly Better Than Revenge. Smothering Tithe is a card I only recently invested a wildcard in and man, oh man was I missing out. Generating disposable mana is incredibly potent, especially against draw decks AND provides the perfect chump fodder against a Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God . All That Glitters should win some kind of record for being in all of our enchantment decks to date, but it’s just so good the decision is warranted. Even at its worst, it’ll give a creature +1/+1 and generate a flying 2/1 so I really can’t ever be complaining. Bad Blood But Chev, if we’re putting our faith in Alela what happens when we take the black? Well, a lot actually. Turns out adding black to our available cardpool is a great way to throw in powerful removal. Who knew?! That’s right, this time we’re not messing around. Yes, we’re still running Heliod’s Punishment and Banishing Light as a first line of defense (and synergy), but fool me twice? Baby, now we got Bad Blood and what we’re going to do will be pretty heartless. …Ready for It? Here’s the decklist, and don’t worry I’m not telling Hanna that We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together. I think she still has an incredible amount of utility because, I mean who can pass up the opportunity to drop Kiora bests the Sea God twice in a single game? Not me, that’s for sure. Alela Swift Commander 1x Alela, Artful Provocateur Creatures 1x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 1x Aphemia, the Cacophony 1x Archon of Sun&#39;s Grace 1x Daxos, Blessed by the Sun 1x Hanna, Ship&#39;s Navigator 1x Healer&#39;s Hawk 1x Luminous Broodmoth 1x Meteor Golem 1x Murderous Rider 1x Stonecoil Serpent 1x Tithe Taker 1x Transcendent Envoy Lands 1x Castle Vantress 1x Command Tower 1x Godless Shrine 1x Fabled Passage 1x Hallowed Fountain 2x Island 10x Plains 4x Swamp 1x Temple of Deceit 1x Temple of Enlightenment 1x Watery Grave Enchantments 1x All That Glitters 1x Angelic Gift 1x Banishing Light 1x Divine Visitation 1x Elspeth Conquers Death 1x Ethereal Absolution 1x Heliod&#39;s Punishment 1x Kiora Bests the Sea God 1x Mire&#39;s Grasp 1x Prison Realm 1x Smothering Tithe 1x Staggering Insight 1x The Birth of Meletis Instants 1x Didn&#39;t Say Please 1x Heartless Act 1x Neutralize 1x Unbreakable Formation Artifacts 1x Arcane Signet 1x Heraldic Banner 1x Midnight Clock 1x Traveler&#39;s Amulet Sorceries 1x Swallow Whole 1x Winged Words I Did Something Bad This deck is a powerhouse. While including all the control power Hanna’s Azorius shell was able to provide, stopping dangerous commander’s in their tracks with Prison Realm or Didn’t Say Please , and keeping such enchantment must-haves like Archon of Sun’s Grace , we’re able to create a solid board state before Alela even hits the board. Once she hits the board, the pace goes up to 11 as we start generating fliers at insane rates and just keep the fight in the air to close out the game. In a five-game run we went 4-1, but this loss was incredibly close and was mainly due to drawing nothing but lands for six straight turns. Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God was able to produce just enough flyers to keep us from lethal until finally dropping a Liliana, Dreadhorde General and making us sac our board. A beautiful fight. One ridiculous highlight I wish I caught on stream was the interaction between Kiora Bests the Sea God and Divine Visitation . It’s all fun and games until the 8/8 hexproof kraken you were counting on becomes a 4/4. Doh. All-in-all, this was the comeback of the month, showing the likes of Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy and Yarok, the Desecrated that there are commanders out there who can really utilize the enchantment theme with power and grace. Call It What You Want, but this truly has been The Best Day. Oh, and if you absolutely fall hard and fast for this deck? Don’t blame me. Alela is here to Stay Stay Stay. Enter The Guildhall &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Call it What You Want (Brawl)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/06/12/brawldt_3.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;outlaws&#39; merriment (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/rev%20your%20engines/2020/06/11/rye_3.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/5/d/5d7585ab-a364-471c-8ef1-318e459b4020.jpg?1572490798&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Outlaws&#39; Merriment (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I sit down in a local park to write my article for this week, the sun is shining bright, there’s a cool breeze complimenting the heat of a new summer, and everyone is outside enjoying our Phase 1 freedom. Life is good and it’s about time we celebrated! The Hexdrinkers are throwing the biggest party in Standard, and you’re all invited! So &lt;em&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/em&gt;, start your grills, and fill up your tankards: it’s time for the &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/eld/198/outlaws-merriment?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/5/d/5d7585ab-a364-471c-8ef1-318e459b4020.jpg?1572490798&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Outlaws’ Merriment &lt;/a&gt;! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Since we’re throwing the greatest rager of all time, we need a crowd to match. Outlaws’ Merriment gives us a new party-goer every turn. Some are a bit rowdy, some are those lovable, friendly drunks, and some are ready to start a fight the minute they show up. They all have one thing in common though: they’re ready to party. The excellent folk metal band Windrose once said, “Nobody is safe in a tavern full of drunken dwarves, no respect for humans, dragons, trolls, or pointy ears…” and that’s exactly what we’re aiming for during our Merriment! All these rough and tumble folk converging ensures scuffles, brawls, and general disorder, making this perfect for an aristocrats shell. A Real Motley Crew We’ll be relying on our outlaws to take one for the team, but they won’t be coming to the party alone. Corpse Knight will make sure that everyone who walks into our party does so with a bang (or more accurately, a ‘ping’). Corpsey’s partner in crime, Cruel Celebrant is also here to get us value on the way out when our outlaws fall in combat or are sacrificed, for the greater good, of course. Celebrant’s big sister, Judith, the Scourge Diva takes the brawl to the next level, making our bandits punch harder and sting even more when they get knocked out. With our constant generation of brawlers, we can attack and block as we please, all while dealing massive damage to our opponent. So far we’ve got humans, zombie, and vampires all joining our party. Let’s add goblins, giants, and more zombies to amp it up to 11! Our outlaws like to go fast and so does Dreadhorde Butcher . The more he gets in clean punches, the more powerful he becomes and he gives a hefty parting gift when he finally falls. Imagine a Butcher going down when we have Judith and Cruel Celebrant on the field, that’s three triggers straight to our opponent’s face! Legion Warboss always rolls up to a party with his whole posse. His token generation will supplement out Outlaws’ Merriment for ETB and death triggers and he also can get into the fray helping to Mentor the rookies who haven’t seen a tavern brawl before. Pulling up the rear is Bonecrusher Giant . He may not have much going on upstairs, but he sure can scrap. If you even so much as look at him the wrong way, he’ll stomp you. Last, but not least is the angriest, scrappiest, and most drunken dwarf in the whole of the tavern: Torbran, Thane of Red Fell . Everyone is going to be hitting A LOT harder when this guy enters the brawl. Perfect for knocking out our opponent. Top Me Off, Barkeep With all these brawlers about, people are bound to be falling left and right. We already have cards like Cruel Celebrant and Judith that benefit from this, so why not help facilitate a little more carnage. Bastion of Remembrance does everything we want for this deck. Making an additional token to get into the mix while draining our opponent for everyone for fall on our side is perfect. Weaponize the Monsters helps us take a proactive role. We can sacrifice our outlaws after blocking for extra value, pick off opposing fighters or planeswalkers, and even go straight to our opponent’s face. To help us get even more value out of our motley crew, Luminous Broodmoth lets them get back up for a second round and go over opposing brawlers.

We want our creatures to die and we want to get value off of it. Throw as many punches as possible and ping your opponents. The revel is swinging in full force and not worrying about any consequences. Life really is good y’all! Summer is just beginning and there are many more festivities to be had. And you can bet that Hexdrinkers is going to be hosting. Every. Single. Week. Stay brewing!

Back in the first few years of Magic’s lifespan, there were only a few releases a year. Wizards, as well as the player base were still falling into their stride. Now, any given year, there are three story sets, a core set, a commander product (or several), a masters set, and some other specialty product or innovation set, totaling thousands of new cards. If you’re looking to stand out and carve a niche, especially in older formats, you have to overcome a backlog of over 20,000 cards from a long and storied history of the game.&lt;/p&gt; Wizards has only gotten better at making more powerful and interesting cards, so on average, a card released now will fall by the wayside quickly. It can be even more rough if you’re a rare or mythic rare. With the rarity premium comes pressure to push boundaries either on rate or in design space. And oftentimes these don’t capture the hearts and minds of the players, or they were simply printed at the wrong time, crowded out by cards printed shortly before or after hand. Not Even a Bigger Boat Will Help Today, we’re talking about one such mythic rare: Impervious Greatwurm , the buy-a-box promo for Guilds of Ravnica. Nearly two years later, this absolute unit of an oversized frog snack has seen zero play. Let’s look a bit further, surely there’s some drastic downside that is keeping this Greatwurm from greatness. Based on the vanilla test alone, we’re already winning big. Looking back on those 20,000+ cards and 27 years of Magic, Impervious Greatwurm has the highest power and toughness of any creature, just beating out RtR’s Worldspine Wurm , and absolutely demolishing the original Ravnica’s Autochthon Wurm (what is it with the Selesnya Conclave and stupidly big wurms?). This thing is even bigger than Emrakul, the Aeons Torn , the original gold standard for “holy crap that thing is massive”. Stats aside, let’s read on. Impervious Greatwurm also has Convoke, a flagship mechanic of the Conclave that’s made appearances in many Ravnican sets, as well as some supplemental sets. Makes sense thematically, and at a CMC of 10, it’s nice that there’s a way to cheat a bit on the cost. But when it’s already so big, that reduction still seems unfair, especially if I’m using my mindset from when I first started playing and Siege Rhino was a god card. But that’s not all, there’s one more line of text on the Greatwurm. Hmm let me see here, “Indestructi-..”, HOLD ON WAIT, WHAT? You mean, not only is it the beefiest of boys, but I can cheat on its mana cost and it’s nearly impossible to get rid of? Someone tell me why, in the name of whatever god(s) you pray to, be it those of Theros, those of Amonkhet, or the Dragon God Nicol Bolas himself, this majestic beast has suffered such injustice?!?! With rotation coming in only a few months, we will make Impervious Greatwurm great again (okay, technically not ‘again’, but ‘for the first time’). I Get By With a Little Help From My Friends Luckily, when it comes to haymakers like the Greatwurm, we have built-in directions, as well as precedence, on how to call it into the fray. For the Selesnyans, strength comes in numbers and you’ll need a lot of poor suckers to wrangle the Greatwurm in. Convoking has been a solid strategy in the past for things such as Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis , Chord of Calling , and March of the Multitudes . That’s a good enough pedigree for us to try it. Standard is flush with token makers to help convoke. My personal favorites would be Raise the Alarm and Omen of the Sun for their rate and instant-speed versatility. Others like Rally for the Throne and March of the Multitudes, fueled by convoke and helping to fuel further convokes, could round out a token package. If you wanted to dip into red, Forbidden Friendship is the best upfront rate you’ll get, and Legion Warboss and Krenko, Tinstreet Kingpin provide recurring token generation. Whichever way you lean, don’t forget to sneak in a couple Emmara, Soul of the Accord ’s and Divine Visitation ’s for maximum value. Wurm Harvest So, convoking allows us to get a reduction on mana cost, but we’re still casting our Greatwurm. That’s way too slow and honest for me, so let’s just cheat him into play! Starting with the strategy’s namesake card, people have been Reanimating the most powerful of creatures since the early days of Magic. Reanimation isn’t as easy to come by as token generation, but there are enough powerful effects to fill out a necromantic package for our guest of honor. Pretty much all necromantic interaction stems from black’s portion of the color pie (with some splashes here or there) and it’s usually going to run you a cool five mana. My choice for best option however, is Back For More . Instant speed is an absolute killer as we can ambush and block, we’ll have pseudo haste, and the fight clause on top means we’re getting a three-for-one nearly every time. Next down the list would be Bond of Revival for the haste. The one thing better than suddenly returning the biggest thing imaginable to play, is your opponent having essentially zero time to deal with it. Blood for Bones is a whole turn or two earlier than other options, but it requires a tribute, as well as not granting extra triggers or keywords. Though, if we’re combining a token/convoke idea with reanimation, this would be a no-brainer. Unbreakable Bond is serviceable as that’s a lot of life we’ll be gaining. Once you’ve hit Cauldron’s Gift you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel, and, though interesting, the density of quality auras needed to make Rise to Glory a consistent two-for-one would stretch our deck thin. (quick shout-out to Elspeth Conquers Death which does have reanimation as its third chapter and is a powerhouse of removal and disruption on its front half) Of course, to fuel our reanimation strategy we’ll need ways to fill our graveyard. The two best options are discard effects or self-mill. Self-mill will put us at least in Golgari, maybe Sultai, depending on how deep we go. If you want a better look at what options there are, check out my Titan’s Nest article. The Binding of the Titans is strong in green, Tymaret Calls the Dead in black, and Merfolk Secretkeeper in blue, amongst others. Gyruda, Doom of Depths does the milling and the reanimating for us all in one, though it is on the higher end in terms of cost and commitment to an all-in strategy. Discard would likely employ red, making us Jund. Cathartic Reunion and Thirst for Meaning both turbo charge our graveyard. For a more in-depth discussion, check out my Offspring’s Revenge article. Money for Nuthin’ and Greatwurms for Free But reanimation is not the only way to cheat Impervious Greatwurm into play. Some cards allow us to forgo casting costs and utilizing other zones: move card directly from hand to field, pass GO, collect $200 and a 16/16 indestructible wurm. In older formats, Show and Tell , Sneak Attack , and Through the Breach have been putting Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Griselbrand directly into play for years, why can’t we have the same fun in Standard? Here is where the pickings start to get, not necessarily slim, but extremely conditional. If you like to roll the dice, activating a Dreamshaper Shaman or down-ticking a Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast is a viable path. Even spicier would be mutating an Auspicious Starrix or Illuna, Apex of Wishes . In all these cases, the deck-building would have to be precise, but you could make it so you hit an Impervious Greatwurm consistently. Most similar to the powerhouses of old are Purphoros, Bronze-Blooded and Ilharg, the Raze-Boar . Purphoros is basically a Sneak Attack on a stick, though having to sacrifice our monstrosity end of turn has always been problematic if we aren’t winning on the spot. Ilharg could be even better as it is a recur-able way to get the wurm into combat, and instead of sacrificing it, returns it to our hand, which sort of protects it. Still, both aren’t the most fool-proof ways to execute our gameplan. Lastly, if you want to play a more controlling game, Flood of Tears could be a lot of fun. Not only is it a great defensive card, but sometimes we’ll get to set down our Greatwurm and set up an offensive. Imagine all this with Teferi, Time Raveler ’s up-tick so you can Flood on the end of our opponent’s turn? Absolutely despicable and I love it. Annelid Aggression Now that I’ve gone on entirely too long about how to actually get Impervious Greatwurm into play, we need to discuss how to win. You might have noticed that one important word was missing from its textbox: trample. Not being able to bypass defenses means people can chump for days and potentially crack back or find an exile or bounce spell. That’s no bueno for us. We could give our Greatwurm a trample counter with Hornbash Mentor or Fully Grown though I doubt those would synergize with the rest of our deck no matter which way we took it. Cycling a Titanoth Rex could actually be beneficial if we were going for a reanimation strategy. T Rex isn’t as big as Greatwurm, but he’ll get the job done if we need him. Auras and equipment can also grant trample. Shadowspear is a versatile card and Setessan Training is cheap and fits the bill perfectly (and it helps make a case for Rise to Glory). Planeswalkers are always powerful inclusions to any deck and The Royal Scions or Vivien, Arkbow Ranger can give our wurm trample for the turn. Both seem to provide enough all-around utility to justify inclusion. There are also creatures who grant trample upon ETB, End-Raze Forerunners being the biggest and baddest. Since we’re already trying to cheapen our Greatwurm, I doubt we want to have to wait an extra turn and pay full price for these bigger tramplers, and if you’re invoking the End-Raze, you’re probably winning anyway. Now, all of these options are plausible, though some more efficient and less far-fetched than others. However, I’m saving what I feel to be the most fool-proof win condition for last. Why bother with trample (we didn’t even discuss unblockability, but trust me that’s an even more convoluted road) when we can go straight to the opponent’s dome? Allow me to introduce a humble two mana red sorcery: Fling . Yes, that’s what this has come to. After all that grandstanding about Impervious Greatwurm getting more love and recognition, we’re sacrificing him for the greater good, martyred for the sake of us climbing the ladder. And that, my friends, is a metaphor, or maybe an actual example of how life isn’t fair. Here’s a build that I put together utilizing the discussion in this article while pushing the envelope even further.

It’s situations like these that we live for here at Hexdrinkers; ignoring the norm and blazing paths in the face of the unknown (I’ve been reading Brandon Sanderson recently, cut me some slack for my bombast). These changes don’t kill all the top-tier decks, and many might flock to the safer tried-and-true strategies emerging from their Companion Winter hibernation, but we at Hexdrinkers like to keep looking forward. A shakeup like this provides opportunities to get wild before things settle into place. Without further adieu, welcome to a two-for-one edition of Homebrewed. You Know I Keep That Thang On Me Creatures 4x Acclaimed Contender 3x Dalakos, Crafter of Wonders 4x Fervent Champion 4x Renowned Weaponsmith 4x Stonecoil Serpent 4x Stormfist Crusader 3x Syr Gwyn, Hero of Ashvale Artifacts 2x Colossus Hammer 4x Embercleave 3x Shadowspear 2x Steelclaw Lance Lands 3x Blood Crypt 2x Fabled Passage 1x Godless Shrine 1x Hallowed Fountain 1x Island 2x Mountain 1x Plains 1x Sacred Foundry 3x Steam Vents 2x Swamp 4x Tournament Grounds 2x Watery Grave This deck originally started with me wanting to do something silly with Colossus Hammer . But looking further into the cardpool, there are some interesting and powerful cards pertaining to equipment in the format. Let’s start by discussing with the actual equipment we’ll be using to pound our opponent’s face in. Tools of the Trade Our armory only consists of four different cards, but they all serve an important purpose. Steelclaw Lance is the blue collar equipment for our deck, but it’s rate as well as sizeable buff means combat is going to be in our favor. Its (much) bigger brother, Colossus Hammer , is arguably a meme cards, but that doesn’t mean it’s gonna stop me from trying to suit somebody up with this and go to town (in all honesty it makes me more likely to do that). It, along with the proven powerhouse, Embercleave , are our best ways of taking our opponent from 20 to zero. To combat any retaliation and wrought divine wrath, we have Shadowspear to cover our bases. Though it’s seen mostly sideboard play since it escaped from the underworld, don’t underestimate it. Between being incredibly cheap to cast and equip and for an aggressive deck like this and giving a creature trample and lifelink to punch through damage while helping us outpace other aggro strategies really helps this gem shine. The anti-hexproof/indestructible ability doesn’t come into play often, but every once in a while it’s clutch, which is just icing on the cake. So those are the knives we’re bringing to the standard gunfight. Now let’s discuss choosing who will fulfill the prophecy and pull them from the sacred stones. We’re the Knights of the Round Table, We Equip When’re We’re Able In order to secure our kingdom, we’ve brought together several powerful knights who curve nicely into each other for a brutal offense. Leading the charge is Fervent Champion . A staple in mono-red decks since their release goes about as fast as you can go. And once multiple attack together the threat level increases even further. However, Fervent Champion has another clause that most people either ignore or don’t even know about: “Equip abilities that target Fervent Champion cost three generic less to activate.” Full stop. That means that cards like Steelclaw Lance, Shadowspear, and an Embercleave that needs to be moved over all equip for free (oh, and that’s also a big chunk off equipping Colossus Hammer)… … all of which we can grab with Acclaimed Contender . I suppose we can’t have anything on the rate of Goblin Ringleader these days, but we’ll take the Contender as they can grab us either another body or an equipment, if our board is in good shape. A full playset of these will help us sift through our deck at a quicker clip and keep the pressure on. But I did say we were curving nicely, so don’t think I forgot the two-drop slot. To compliment Acclaimed Contender’s digging we have Stormfist Crusader as continual source of card draw, impressive in a Mardu tribe (Note: not exactly known for drawing cards). Plus, a 2/2 menace for two ain’t too shabby. Sure our opponent also draws a card, but they’re taking damage and they sure aren’t going to outrace us. Recently brainwashed and conscripted by the evil forces of Rakdos Sacrifice, let’s bring this defender of the realm back to the side of justice. Lastly, commanding our forces is the majestic, Syr Gwyn, Hero of Ashvale . Though once a hero, but she’s been forced to take an early retirement. Not even Brawl players have taken to this card (probably due to the fact that it costs six, c’mon Wizards you could’ve pushed this card a bit as opposed to so many others), so it’s up to us here at Hexdrinkers to find Syr Gwyn a home (nudge nudge Chev, get on it). Once we can get her onto the field, the Hero of Ashvale is an absolute beast with sizable stats and excellent keywords. Even more importantly she gives us free equips (the Colossus Hammer dream shines a bit brighter) and more card advantage, which is crucial to push a deck like this across the finish line. Rise, and become a Hero once more in our crusade upon a new Standard format! That’s a capable and sizable army that we’ve recruited, but every army needs support staff; medics, squires, and most importantly, blacksmiths, all round out a successful war effort. Our forces are no different. Manning the forges today are two masters of their craft. So many equipment through the years just weren’t viable due to a high mana cost, high equip cost or a combination of both, but no longer. With Dalakos, Crafter of Wonders and Renowned Weaponsmith , we can expedite the forging and fitting of our steel. Dalakos also must put a little extra spice into his blades giving those who wield them the ability to zoom into the sky providing much needed evasion and speed; he gives them flying and haste. Begrudgingly, ‘flaste’ doesn’t sound as good as ‘flample’ (flying+trample). But how else are these knights suppose to slay dragons? In addition to weapons, our craftsmen have whipped up something a little more sentient and just as deadly. Stonecoil Serpent can be fueled by both Dalakos and R.W., growing to preposterous sizes, and can hold back flyers and multicolored threats all day (looking at you Dream Trawler ). Another welcome addition to the front lines. That’s the deck, a nice twist on an aggro deck incorporating a recently overlooked tribe and card type. In this new standard aggro decks will be especially potent, so this deck is an out of the box to approach the format. But if you thought that’s all for today, you’re mistaken good friends. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I only gave you one option, so I’ve prepared another deck with not Eldraine at its core, but Theros! This one is another aggro deck because there’s something cathartic about hitting “All Attack” on Arena. Zero to Hero Artifacts 3x Embercleave Creatures 2x Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice 3x Hero of the Games 3x Hero of the Nyxborn 4x Hero of the Pride 1x Heroes of the Revel 4x Hero of the Winds Enchantments 1x Conclave Tribunal 2x Omen of the Sun Instants 3x Fight as One 3x Gods Willing 2x Unbreakable Formation 4x Raise the Alarm Sorceries 2x Forbidden Friendship 2x Swallow Whole Lands 2x Castle Ardenvale 2x Castle Embereth 6x Mountain 9x Plains 4x Sacred Foundry Theros Beyond Death had this series of ‘Hero’ cards that made one helluva Boros aggro deck in draft. With all the auras in the set you could suit up a Hero and what I’d like to dub the ‘Hero Clause’ (a nod to original Theros’s ‘Heroic’ mechanic) kicks in buffing your whole team. It’s like in any superhero movie where at the edge of defeat, the leader of {insert your favorite named assemblage of superheroes} gives their rousing speech about not giving up and the power of friendship and working together and every gets their energy back plus more to defeat the baddies. Or maybe that was the plot of every Shounen anime ever… Anyway! I thought, why assemble the greatest version of this draft deck ever made and take a whole legion of heroes to war in Standard. And you know how it goes over here at Hexdrinkers, once that thought takes shape, we have to deliver it to y’all, fully fleshed out. With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility Our creature suite is very streamlined as they’re almost all Heroes. This means they’re a red or white creature that has the Hero Clause: whenever you cast a spell that targets this creature, creatures you control get +1/+0. Wizards has conveniently printed a bevy of heroes for us that curve out nicely. Hero of the Pride , into Hero of the Nyxborn / Hero of the Games , into Hero of the Winds , into Heroes of the Revel ? Yes please. And every great Hero has a sidekick (or several). We are no different, so we want a lot of buddies for our heroes. Heroes of the Revel and Hero of the Nyxborn already provide us an extra body apiece. We’re also running Raise the Alarm , Forbidden Friendship , and Omen of the Sun . Each provides a great ratio of mana invested to bodies and instant speed lets us ambush as well as set up a sneak attack. Lastly, we need ways to target our Heroes so we can beef up our team. Gods Willing is a great way to blank removal spells, win stalemates in combat, or even potentially sneak past blocks. Fight as One protects and buffs our creatures and we have a good balance of human and non-humans so we can utilize both modes. Swallow Whole is a sneaky pick as not only does it remove dangers across the battlefield (and synergizing with our token generation; tapping a creature isn’t a downside when you have so many), but it also targets our creatures so we can buff them! Double whammy, baby. Round out the deck with some extra punch in Embercleave , some protection in Unbreakable Formation , and a battle-hardened general, Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice and you’re ready to bring peace and order to the multiverse! Brave New World The recent bannings and rules change have shaken up many formats, especially Standard. The format has been busted wide open in the chaos. It’s time to try new things, have fun brewing, and of course, smash face. That’s it for this installment of Homebrewed!

I promised y’all last time that we’d play this cycling deck, so let’s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt; This deck is swift as a coursing river and packs all the force of a great typhoon (not a shark typhoon though, that doesn’t cycle for one mana). It also has all the strength of a raging fire, but dammit it’s not mysterious as the dark side of the moon! It’s basic and trash. And so am I. Real talk this deck is dumb, but it’s fun to play and that’s all that matters. If you’re drinking with this deck, please relegate yourself to a Truly (an inferior seltzer to White Claw) or Natty Light (which might just be water), you don’t deserve any better. Editor’s Note: Chev here, this deck brought Julian to Platinum so don’t listen to a word he says.

Now, I know I said I would do whatever the winner of our poll was but…as of writing, it’s tied. I’ll give that another week to simmer and instead celebrate the release of a new legendary creature to our fair format, courtesy of this month’s Brawl Guildhall! Give it up forrrrrrrrr Hanna, Ship’s Navigator!&lt;/p&gt; Originally appearing in Invasion, Hanna has a long legacy with the game in both lore and Brawl’s big brother Commander. For you more enfranchised players, I can already see your grins widening at the notion of repeatable graveyard recursion. One only needs to glance at her EDHRec Page to see the potential of constantly having access to a Seal of Cleansing , Cataclysmic Gearhulk , or even nastier. Most Hanna builds are controlling, limiting opponents’ resources while you build up a pillow fort. The ability to bring back threats like Wurmcoil Engine over and over again…well that’s generally icing on the cake. So what happens when you try to port a similar strategy to Brawl? Hit me Baby One More Time Hanna’s power is going to come from her flexibility in getting whatever piece of tech you need at the current moment from the yard. Need to make a substantial threat for an easy 5 mana? One activation and an All that Glitters got you covered. Need protection? How about reanimating an Alseid of Life’s Bounty ? Be they your Banishing Light or Staggering Insight , having access to your best pieces over and over again is incredibly powerful. While we will be recurring a few deadly artifacts like Meteor Golem and Crystalline Giant , our main focus will be on enchantments since TBD has such an incredible amount of support for that theme. So, what enchantments benefit the most coming back from the yard? An Enchanted Return Ashiok’s Erasure is probably not what comes to anyone’s mind when they think “counter spell”. It’s four mana, doesn’t fully destroy the spell, and feels a little clunky. I mean it’s an Oblivion Ring for spells. However, as we found out in our previous build (see link below), not only are the Oblivion Rings and Heliod’s Punishment of the format better than we gave them credit for, not a lot of people are running artifact or enchantment removal. So now we’re talking about a card that will exile a potential threat and hey if this gets axed, we can do it again! I’m actually not sure if this is worth including over another counterspell, so if you’re looking for things to tweak this is a fair target. However, in honor of our commander I feel there is a significant thematic boost to including this wild card. Shark Typhoon is really a perfect example of a Hanna target. If Shark Typhoon is played as an enchantment your opponent can relive the terror (cheesy, but terror nonetheless) of Sharknado. If you just need a really big flying shark (and really who doesn’t), cycle it and prepare to bring it back with Hanna. All Sharks all the time. The Birth of Meletis highlights another key category of cards in our deck: sagas. These enchantments have a limited lifespan, meaning as soon as Hanna is ready we’ll have the ability to start them right over. Coming in at two mana, The Birth of Meletis is certainly the cheapest Saga we have and most likely to be replayed in a consistent fashion. Searching for a land, creating bodies, and gaining a little life is a consistent set of abilities that can’t win on their own…but certainly provide the grease in our recursion machine to keep us in longer games. Banishing Light has all the same talking points as Ashiok’s Erasure. It removes a threat from the board and can be a potential target for Hanna if it ends up in the graveyard. Brawl is a format of big monsters, and removal always comes at a premium. Not much more to say about this powerhouse besides it’s an effect we’re quadrupling up on between Conclave Tribunal , Heliod’s Punishment , and Prison Realm . Junk Diving Moving on to potential artifact targets, we don’t have many but each fills a very necessary slot for any Brawl deck. We have: graveyard hate, removal, and terrifying threats. What more could you ask for?! Nothing. This is perfect and I love them all. Soul-Guide Lantern fills a familiar role to anyone who’s seen our Brawl builds before: hating on those nasty graveyards. All graveyard strategies are bogus unless we’re the ones currently using it and being able to target a sneaky Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath or Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger is an incredible benefit. Get out of here with your shenanigans. Also, in a build like this one we might actually be able to use the Lantern’s second mode and use it to draw the occasional card or two. I doubt you’ll be able to create an endless cycle, but it’s nice to know you have the option. Meteor Golem will obliterate anything. No questions asked. Best case, your opponent takes out their vengeance on it’s relatively minor 3/3 body or you can chump, putting Meteor Golem right into the graveyard for Hanna to pick up. Crystalline Giant is just a rude card. Slowly building up into an absolute beast or maybe trading as soon as it gets deathtouch. Either way, I’d expect this to be brought back multiple times a game. Other Notable Set Pieces Outside of recursion targets, our deck needs a few other powerful payoff cards to build up to. We can’t just rely on our removal and disruption because… well, that’s no fun. We’re playing Brawl, we’re here to fight and take names. So that being said, meet the opponent-might-concede bombs we’re packing. Dance of the Manse is our other big payoff for filling the yard with artifacts and enchantments. Unlike Hanna, Dance brings them all back directly to the battlefield. baBOOM! That’s right, we’ll flood the board with used removal, sagas, and one or two artifacts that have the chance to also become an army of 4/4s. Come at us. It should also be noted that any auras returned with Dance like Heliod’s Punishment or Ichthyomorphosis can get around some pesky punk with hexproof. I don’t see this being a big thing, but it’s worth pointing out! Out-tech your opponents! Anyway, I see Dance as the be-all finisher card that the rest of your deck spends the game preparing to cast. Cavalier of Dawn serves as another piece of non-conditional removal, maybe giving our opponent a 3/3 golem or…remember a couple turns ago when you used Banishing Light on their commander? Commander’s back in the zone, and your enchantment is just sitting on the battlefield with nothing to do. So target that, get a 3/3 Golem for yourself and the ability to exile something else in a couple turns! The most excellent of value. It’s almost too good with the added death trigger allowing you to bring something back to your hand for free. This is easily one of my favorite cards in the deck when played right. Kiora Bests the Sea God needs no write-up or speech convincing you why you should include it. 8/8 Hexproof Threat, Tap everything down, and if they’re not dead by then…steal their commander. This will end games, and if it doesn’t, I’m pretty sure your opponent won’t want to stick around for round two. So that’s it! Let’s see what this deck can get up to! Hanna, Ship&#39;s Navigator Enchantments Creatures 1x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 1x Arcanist&#39;s Owl 1x Callaphe, Beloved of the Sea 1x Cavalier of Dawn 1x Crystalline Giant 1x Meteor Golem 1x Starfield Mystic 1x Transcendent Envoy Lands 1x Command Tower 1x Emergence Zone 1x Fabled Passage 1x Hallowed Fountain 10x Island 11x Plains 1x Temple of Enlightenment 1x Tranquil Cove Sorceries 1x Bond of Insight 1x Dance of the Manse 1x Swallow Whole Planeswalkers 1x Kasmina, Enigmatic Mentor Enchantments 1x All That Glitters 1x Ashiok&#39;s Erasure 1x Banishing Light 1x Conclave Tribunal 1x Elspeth Conquers Death 1x Heliod&#39;s Punishment 1x Ichthyomorphosis 1x Kiora Bests the Sea God 1x Mirrormade 1x Omen of the Sea 1x Prison Realm 1x Shark Typhoon 1x Staggering Insight 1x The Birth of Meletis Instants 1x Dovin&#39;s Veto 1x Keep Safe 1x Neutralize 1x Thirst For Meaning Artifacts 1x Arcane Signet 1x Soul-Guide Lantern Conclusions For better or worse, the game has evolved since Hanna first came on the scene. What seems like a pretty powerful ability at first glance may not be as strong as you thought it was. For starters, Hanna needs to see untap before she can even get to her recursion shenanigans and most often commanders are either killed on sight, or countered (which is even worse when it’s Tale’s End ). Then, her ability can only be activated once per turn without significant help and you’ll still need to cast whatever you get back. Compared to the likes of Muldrotha, the Gravetide , this seems incredibly too slow in 1v1. It also makes everything that does provide immediate value, through ETBs or being a blocker, far more enticing to cast each turn. Why play a 1/2 that can do something next turn when I can drop a Crystalline Giant that will upgrade on the turn I play it? This deck went 4-1, but on only one of those wins was Hanna even a factor. Most of the time it was the UW shell that beat our opponents down long enough to either draw a threat or until they concede having no more threats to play. In fact, our one loss came from looking down the barrel of a more modern artifact/enchantment commander who was able to provide utility immediately to her growing army: Alela, Artful Provocateur . Losing the ability to bring back a couple enchantments per game is made up for in spades with access to black and generating a flying army of fairies that slowly prick you to death. Hanna just couldn’t keep up. Two games were won in part by Crystalline Giant with an All That Glitters , either by becoming an 11/11 flyer with first strike and deathtouch or an…11/11 flyer with first strike and a very lucky Kiora bests the sea god tapping all their creatures. I will give a special highlight to the final game, the one where Hanna actually came out to whoop some ass. It was against Snapdax, Apex of the Hunt and we had set up this beautiful board of Hanna, The Birth of Meletis , and a couple removal spells systematically taking down each potential Snapdax mutate target. Once our Elspeth Conquers Death hit the graveyard and was targeted by a Hanna activation the opponent scooped fearing the constant loop of being conquered ad nauseum. Woohoo! I think Elspeth would be proud of that one. So overall, this was a good build of UW Enchantment Control that was able to successfully limit the threats of our opponents until we could come up with a win con. While it’s not what I’m typically looking for, it was a lot of fun to play. Hanna kind of served as a nice bonus when she worked, but overall it feels like magic has passed her by. Hopefully she sees a powerful reboot much like the rest of the Weatherlight crew! So until next time!

Legendary heroes battling for supremacy using their might and wisdom and general badassery? Sit down, grab a drink. It’s time to learn about Brawl.&lt;/p&gt; No, not that one. Get outta here, this is a Magic site. We’re talking Brawl the format (although I’d completely understand if more of you were familiar with the former.) My love for Brawl started at the Dominaria prerelease. It was just after the format was introduced and Dominaria was built for Brawl on a fundamental level. Each pack had a dedicated legendary slot, and the prerelease box came with an extra date-stamped legendary. Originally, I had chalked up Brawl as a one-off way for Wizards to bring the Commander community into the rotating Standard environment and saw Brawl support just as a way to level up some of my 99-card decks…but as I flipped through those six packs of cards, my mind just started forming connections. A limited cardpool lacking “staples” can breed creativity. I found myself drowning in potential options and was mentally sorting cards into build categories for at least half the deck construction time and spent the rest of the prerelease scheming potential decks in the back of my head. I’m going to pretend that the preoccupation with potential Brawl builds is why I walked away from the event without a win to my name. But who cares!!! I knew exactly what I needed to structure a Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive deck OR how I planned to trade my friend Harrison for his Josu Vess, Lich Knight to aide Aryel, Knight of Windgrace in knight tribal. After leaving the event, I spent the entire walk home trying to convince my friends to give Brawl a shot. Considering half of them had never even played Magic before that day, I knew I might be facing an uphill battle…but the resistance never came. Maybe it’s the casual nature of multiplayer magic where all four of us could just sit down with a beer or two after a day of class and sling spells at each other. It could also have been the powerful narrative of choosing a specialized general to lead your troops into battle. Either way we all agreed to give it a shot. I was ecstatic. I met all these guys while studying abroad in New Zealand that semester, so even those of us who had some experience with the game were in a position where no one had any collection of cards to fall back on. Initially, we all just had those prerelease packs. This was incredibly fortunate for the budding playgroup to start on such equal footing, and allowed us to really experiment with combos of cards that otherwise would have seemed ridiculous. Eventually we found a local game store that would give draft chaff to students for free, and maybe we bought a pack or two…but singles were pretty much out of the question. I felt such a strong connection to when my friends back home and I had just started playing in High School. Both metas were defined by low-powered decks with one or two mid-tier rares that were absolutely devastating when dropped. Things like Helm of the Host or Siege-Gang Commander were among the biggest game-ending threats if they were allowed to get out of hand. Luckily this time around, everyone was able to skip the stage of only playing the coolest threats without any answers. If I were to list my all-time favorite Magic memories, that semester in New Zealand playing with low-powered brawl decks would easily be in the top three. It was really a testament to what crafty strategies we could build from the limited pool we had. To give an example of one of my sweetest creations, here is a selection from my Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive deck that’s still one of my favorite builds to this day. Any equipment that gave just a boost to power was an instant include, making my wild army of blue 2/1s into actual threats (as long as Tetsuko was on the field), and Champion of Wits served as a sweet piece of late game tech to loot away any nasty lands while serving as a reasonable body in the early game. Considering how fragile my army was, there were also a fair number of counterspells like Unwind or Wizard’s retort , much to everyone else’s chagrin. Hey! Man’s gotta protect his army of ninjas, am I right?! The group eventually coalesced around Darigaaz, Reincarnated , Hallar, the Fire Fletcher , Slimefoot, the Stowaway , and Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive . We’d all gather round a booth in the lobby of our student housing with maybe a beer or soda from the machine and spend the night laughing at the absurdity of being slowly whittled down by a Graven Abomination until someone could draw an Abrade . Then, maybe we’d go down to Burger Fuel for a bite or end up doing a bit of group studying. It was the perfect pressure release and a time dedicated to seeing friends amongst everyone’s busy schedules. After that initial Dominaria hype, the community’s love for Brawl also drastically declined. There were a few powerhouse cards that needed to be banned, (see: Baral, Chief of Compliance ) and Wizards had only pushed Brawl for that one set so support was severely lacking in Core 19 and Guilds of Ravnica. Sure, there were legendary creatures, but no excitement from the Mothership to spur innovative design in the format. I think one of the final nails in that early coffin was fall rotation, when all the commander players realized why a lot of them had drifted away from rotating formats in the first place…half their deck was no longer usable. But like all good things, eventually it came to an end. When I returned home, I really struggled to get any of my “killer” brawl designs upgraded into the commander meta. All the strategy and unique designs I’d spent months crafting didn’t really hold a candle to the more powered-up strategies of a legacy cardbase, and I found myself not really wanting to tarnish the memories I had with particular standard cards in favor of pushing a deck out. Since I didn’t have a brawl group anymore my interest in the format really petered, and it seems I wasn’t alone. Official Support didn’t return until Eldraine over a year later. This time, with preconstructed Brawl decks to really spur momentum. Most demand for these products ended up going towards Commander since at that point the Brawl player base was around two people. New staples like Arcane Signet and Tome of Legends instantly started popping up on EDHRec, but besides a couple articles the lasting Brawl impact wasn’t there. I don’t think many people even considered these cards for Brawl at the time. Maybe you’d play a few precon games with friends, but then you’d immediately turn Chulane, Teller of Tales into a beastly 100 card monstrosity. It really took the introduction of Brawl into Arena shortly after to give the format the jump it needed. Giving Commander players (and a budding Brawl community) a version of their favorite format online was an incredible selling point, and even though Wizards started small (only weekly events and some special occasions to play), the numbers wanting to line up behind their favorite legendary and throw hands only grew. That of course brings us to the present day. Now, Arena is only increasing its Brawl offerings from weekly queues to month-long events that give incredibly powerful legendaries from sets past their turn to completely rock the metagame. Stagnation is no longer something to associate with Brawl. Finally, two years after I dropped Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive for the first time, Brawl is getting the recognition it deserves. Alright I’m Hooked, What are the Specifics? Brawl’s official announcement from WOTC can be found here. TLDR: You build a 60 card singleton deck (the deck can only have one copy of each card besides basic lands), with one powerful legendary creature or planeswalker as your “commander” who starts outside the game. Think of this legendary character as the general of your forces. The best brawl decks build around the effects of their commander to create a synergy that benefits from constant access to your commander who starts essentially as an eighth card in hand. Also, being a singleton format you only ever need one copy of any given card. This becomes a huge boon when looking at MTGA’s wildcard structure. You don’t really want to be spending 4 wildcards on a playset of Breeding Pool s, right? Sure they’re cool but you’d rather save your redeems for Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath or Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy . It gives a lot more flexibility on how to spend your hard-earned wins when you don’t need to buy 4-ofs to be competitive. That should not dissuade enfranchised players though.The singleton nature of the format creates a landscape much harder to solve since it lacks the consistency of other 60-card formats. Finding ways to enact a successful game plan across multiple matches is an incredible puzzle to solve. Brawl’s Official Rules Unlike Commander, whose rules are handled by an external entity to Wizards, The Rules Committee, Wizards handles Brawl in-house and can provide the most in-depth description of the various mechanical specifics here. Brawl functions almost exactly like Commander, so if you’re a recent convert from Brawl’s big older brother the TLDR is your commander can be either a standard-legal legendary creature OR Planeswalker, and the starting life total for 1-on-1 is 25. It goes up to 30 for games of more than 2 people which I did not know…until I was doing research for this article. For those of you more unfamiliar with Commander… Your Commander is a Legendary Creature or Planeswalker who starts outside the game, meaning your initial deck is only 59 cards. All cards in your deck must fit into the color identity of your Commander. If your commander is a Simic creature, all spells in your deck must be blue, green, both, or colorless. The easy way to check this is if any other mana symbol outside of what’s on your commander shows up ANYWHERE on a card - you can’t use it. MTGA will also help and notify you of illegal cards if you choose one. Your first mulligan is free, so the first time you decide to shuffle your hand back into your deck - you draw seven cards again. After that, it follows normal London Mulligan rules Perhaps the biggest new concept is this idea of the “Command Zone” i.e. where your Commander starts the game. Basically, it’s a special place where you can cast your commander from any time you could cast them from your hand. The benefit is, any time your commander would be moved from one zone to another (battlefield to exile, graveyard to exile, hand to graveyard, etc.) …you can choose to have them sent BACK to the Command zone instead! Making sure you always have access to what is probably your greatest weapon. Now, this does come at a cost though: Each time your commander is sent back to the command zone, it’ll cost two more generic mana to cast the next time. This is called Commander Tax and balances some of the benefit of always having your commander accessible. Brewing Since Brawl is a much newer format than Commander, and due to the lack of content produced in 2019 until Eldraine about the format…there aren’t nearly as many resources available if you’re looking for ideas. Initially, EDHRec had an entire site dedicated to Brawl but as of right now that still hasn’t come back. Luckily, MTGGoldfish and a couple others can offer some ideas on what people are currently playing. I’d be careful starting with a net deck though! It can be difficult to make your own connections between cards after seeing something you might consider as “better.” Always scheme out your own idea first, maybe focusing on just cards already in your collection - and use these sites as ways to upgrade or add new things. Or, if you really just want to jump in at a competitive level all decks on MTGGoldfish are listed with their popularity in the current meta. Once you have a Commander in mind…Here are some tips that might help you on your journey to build the ultimate 60-card temple to badassitude. Your Commander should be built around: With the recent focus on legendary creatures to the benefit of both Commander and Brawl, there are a huge selection of generals to choose from - and your deck should hone in on what your commander does best. Goodstuff is a viable strategy, but generally building something that focuses on your Commander’s unique identity will benefit you even more. For example, recently I’ve started building a Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy deck to try out new stuff from Ikoria. Since Kinnan boosts the power of anything that isn’t a land tapping for mana by crazy amounts that was a big emphasis in my design process. Normally in Simic I wouldn’t think Chromatic Lantern , Heraldic Banner , or Midnight Clock necessary - but their added utility to make bonkers mana makes them stand out far more than normal. Another example is with Siona, Captain of the Pyleas . Hopefully you can tell Siona really wants to be in a deck with a high amount of auras and enchantments…but don’t forget that second clause of token generation! Maybe it’s not your main theme…but throwing in a Divine Visitation and maybe one or two other token generators might not be a bad use for a couple slots! Take notes of what cards you see other people playing: In a vein of “learn from your mistakes,” the brawl meta is so incredibly different from Standard that even if you’ve been playing standard for quite some time - cards are going to come up you had no idea existed. Maybe you’ve come up with a sick General Kudro of Drannith deck when someone drops a General’s Enforcer …Write that down! I hadn’t even considered Jiang Yanggu, Wildcrafter for my Kinnan deck until someone else turned their entire board into mana dorks that each tap for two and allowed their Kinnan to go off several times a turn! That game didn’t last long after… I’m also ashamed to admit that I had completely forgotten both Arcane Signet and Command Tower were in Arena until someone else played them. Actually, on that note…. Get Arcane Signet and Command Tower: You wouldn’t have gotten these in packs, but they’re so incredibly powerful and should probably go in every deck you make. Plus, they’re both commons and I cannot think of a more powerful impact that can be made by literally any other cards legal in the format. Get yourself some incredibly cheap mana fixing to offset the cost of buying/crafting a shock land. Take Rotation Into account: Brawl does have the same looming threat as Standard. Come Fall, how many of my cards will still be useful? This can be an incredibly annoying thought when first starting in the format but shouldn’t be something that you worry too much about. Apart from the occasional Historic Brawl event, maybe you do want to focus your efforts on including cards from Eldraine, Theros Beyond Death, and Ikoria. I will admit though, the sacrifice of one mythic wildcard for a Hydroid Krasis …is definitely one worth making. You still have like six months to enjoy its absurdity, and your deck would be better for it! Finally, watch streams! Like with any other format, you can learn a lot from watching other people play the Brawl decks they’ve meticulously created and care about - see synergies and ideas for their decks that you didn’t even think of. I suppose this is also the point where I should shamelessly plug our streams - where personally, I’ll be playing a fair bit of brawl in the coming days and hopefully this article will convince Julian to join in as well… Now go out, have fun, and let us know what you think! Enter The Guildhall &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;An Introduction to Brawl&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/05/28/brawl_primer.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;hello dawn, my old friend (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/homebrewed/2020/05/28/Zirda_combo.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/1/b/1bd8e61c-2ee8-4243-a848-7008810db8a0.jpg?1590710486&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Dawn, My Old Friend (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Homebrewed&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://wheelhouseworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TakeThis-1.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 75%;&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, a wise old man bequeathed this wisdom unto a young hero. Nowadays, these words could not be more true. If you have decided to venture into any format over the past month you probably noticed players bringing Companions to battle in record numbers. Powerhouses like Yorion, Sky Nomad , Keruga, the Macrosage , and Gyruda, Doom of Depths have dominated Standard, while much more sinister companions have reached into older formats. Lurrus of the Dream-Den has already gone so far as to have been banned in Legacy AND Vintage. (Note, Lurrus is the only card in Vintage banned for power level. Yeah.) With Companions being ubiquitous in Magic today (and what appears to be a sweeping ban announcement on the horizon), I decided to adopt the “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em” mindset and give a speculative final hurrah to one lucky Ikorian. Today’s Companion of choice is none of those I’ve mentioned above. However, it shares a spot with Lurrus as the only other Companion to have faced a ban so far: Zirda, the Dawnwaker . Like a Normal Fox, but Spicier Zirda is my personal favorite of all the companions. First, this fox is hella cute. If it wasn’t made of fire, I’d wanna be cuddling it pronto. Zirda also encourages activated abilities which I think are an underrated and underutilised part of magic. People want the instant gratification of an ETB, but properly building around activated abilities can accrue a crushing amount of advantage turn after turn. Lastly, Zirda is a Boros Commander who doesn’t care about the combat step.. okay maybe a little considered its own ability, but it doesn’t scream, “Attack Attack Attack” like an Aurelia, the Warleader or Tajic, Blade of the Legion . I like Wizards exploring design space outside of the red-zone for Boros, which is arguably the worst color pair in EDH. I love Commander and I might do a series on making Boros great again, but this article is about Standard, so let us (let me) refocus. As I said, Zirda, like Lurrus, has a banning under its belt. It was recently stricken from Legacy likely due to the prevalence of Grim Monolith and Basalt Monolith allowing for infinite mana, which tends to win games. Since we’re adhering to the motto of ‘joining’ not ‘beating’, infinite mana sounds like a good idea to me too! “But Julian,” you may be asking yourself, “surely if there was an easy way to go infinite in Standard, we would have already seen it!” The answer is elementary, my dear Watsons. There isn’t an easy way, but there is a way. Real talk, it took me a few whole days of research to put the combo of making infinite mana together and then another couple days to put together some ways to win with it. Zi’Rube’da Goldberg First let’s discuss the combo itself. Just like Zirda’s interaction with the monoliths, or looking to cards like Training Grounds , the key to generating infinite mana is a loop of tapping and untapping that will net you mana each iteration. The only card in Standard that allows this iterative ability of untapping is this uncommon gem from Core Set M20: Gauntlets of Light . Now, as much as the Hexdrinkers appreciates big butts, we only care about the second clause: the untap ability for two and a white. Three mana is a bit much to pay to untap though, luckily Zirda gives us a discount so we only need to pay one white mana to untap! But there are still a lot of unanswered questions… … like, where are we getting this white mana and what creatures are we untapping with it? Faeburrow Elder and Incubation Druid are two of the most versatile mana producers in standard. Not only can they produce any color you might need (and we are running four colors) but they both have the potential to tap for multiple mana. Faeburrow Elder taps for green and white just by itself and can add even more colors depending on what we have out. Incubation Druid can only get one color of mana at a time, but after it adapts it’s still a Gilded Lotus with legs, which is not shabby. Not to mention, Zirda’s static ability can give us an early adapt. So now we’ve assembled our combo. With Zirda and either Faeburrow Elder or an adapted Incubation Druid suited up with the Gauntlets of Light, we can tap for two or three (or four if we’re lucky) and then untap for a single white, netting us mana. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum. Excellent, we have as much mana as we could want in any combination of colors! Now what? Hulk Smash, Brush Wagg Almighty Brushwagg is a meme card, right? Wrong. The Brushwagg is the king of the Ikorian jungle and it is with his might that we shall conquer our enemies. You see, the Brushwagg may be small on the surface, but it hides untold power in the form of an activated ability pumping it into an absolute beater. With our combo we can have an arbitrarily (read, ‘infinitely’) large amount of mana which means we have an arbitrarily (read, ‘infinitely’) large Brushwagg. 20 life you say? The Brushwagg waits for no man, woman, or creature. With Ram Through , our Brushwagg can take the fight straight to our opponent by trampling through any poor excuse for a defense our opponent can muster with lethal damage. And this can all happen outside combat. The Brushwagg laughs at summoning sickness. And heavens forbid our opponent attempts to slay our Brushwagg, it can Fling itself, dragging them to hell with it. Where There’s a Wish, There’s a Way Now, some of you may have noticed the elephant in the room. Zirda, as a Companion, has a deck building restriction: all permanents in our starting deck must have activated abilities. Faeburrow Elder and Incubation Druid have their mana abilities. Brushwagg has its pump ability. But Gauntlets of Light… well, it gives the untap ability to the creature it enchants, so it doesn’t pass the test. But, as it is the linchpin of our combo, we need to find a loophole. What if, instead of it being in our starting deck, it were in our sideboard? That adheres to regulations. Now, we just have to retrieve it, and nobody does the job better than Fae of Wishes ! (people often forget they have an activated ability, but it comes in handy) Playing four Fae of Wishes to grab our Gauntlets from the sideboard may seem a little extra, but it’s necessary for the sake of the combo, which is admittedly extra in itself, but “you are what you brew” or however that saying goes. I did take this chance to utilize the sideboard a bit more and placed an additional copy of Fling and Ram Through there, as well as a Keep Safe to protect our combo and an Expansion//Explosion . Which, admittedly, is the best win condition for this deck, but I’ve lost to it enough that I have a grudge. Plus the Brushwagg is wayyyyyyy cooler. The rest of the deck is pretty straight forward. Shimmer of Possibility , Adventurous Impulse , and Incubation//Incongruity all find our combo pieces. Alseid of Life’s Bounty and Keep Safe protect our combo. Paradise Druid fixes our mana and wishes it was Faeburrow Elder or Incubation Druid. Definitely feel free to customize the sideboard with whatever silver bullets are appropriate, or just more redundancy. Admittedly, this deck is fragile. It’s built for finding our pieces consistently and quickly. Disruption is not our friend. Also, the one-of, or sideboard nature of our win conditions is a gamble that I had to take in order to make the deck run on all cylinders. Lastly, the manabase was hard to decide on since we’re playing four colors and our pieces are all over the spectrum. Luckily our dorks can fix our mana pretty good, so I’m not extremely concerned. Dawnest Before the Dark Companion Zirda, the Dawnwaker Creatures 4x Almighty Brushwagg 4x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 4x Fae of Wishes 4x Faeburrow Elder 4x Incubation Druid 4x Paradise Druid Instants 1x Fling 4x Incubation//Incongruity 1x Keep Safe 1x Ram Through Sorceries 4x Adventurous Impulse 3x Shimmer of Possibility Lands 1x Breeding Pool 2x Fabled Passage 6x Forest 2x Hallowed Fountain 2x Island 4x Ketria Triome 1x Plains 1x Sacred Foundry 1x Steam Vents 1x Stomping Ground 1x Temple Garden Sideboard 1x Expansion//Explosion 1x Fling 4x Gauntlets of Light 1x Keep Safe 1x Ram Through And that’s the deck! This one was a crazy puzzle to fit together and though I doubted its competitive viability, we did go 2-3! After getting beat down by super aggressive decks that went under us, getting that combo off for the first time was exhilarating. The second time was just as good because we fought our way through a Dream Trawler and TWO Agent of Treachery ’s. Ways to upgrade the deck would be better mana, though we didn’t really have any issues, and more consistent ways to find our pieces, though there aren’t really any tutors in Standard. Lastly, the only drink I recommend for this deck is one you’re comfortable pouring out for the looming loss of Zirda and all the Companions. Rev Your Engines will be returning soon with a real rager, so stay tuned, and stay brewing y’all!

Suit up your creatures with only the finest of fineries and then gracefully waltz into the chaos that is the combat step.

Messing with the graveyard, self-milling, and being generally tricksy is right up Sultai’s alley. Now we swing to the opposite end of the spectrum with the most straight forward wedge, Mardu: lovers of bloodshed, conflict, and the thrill of the kill. And what’s even better than a bunch of bloodthirsty berserkers charging their foes? A bunch of bloodthirsty berserkers riding into battle on spike-studded motorcycles, Mad Max style! Rev Your Engines my brethren, for we’ll be riding into the Standard battlefield eternal, shiny, and chrome with the might of &lt;a class=&quot;accented-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://scryfall.com/card/iko/198/offsprings-revenge?utm_source=api&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; data-placement=&quot;top&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;img src=&#39;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/7/8/78619ffb-f514-4f9f-9d77-3ab49e045f7c.jpg?1586457085&#39; width=100% height=100%&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; Offspring’s Revenge &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Offspring’s Revenge illustrates a tale as old as time: the maturation of an orphan into a bloodthirsty killing machine swearing to avenge their fallen parent. It reminds me of what Bambi could have been if Disney weren’t cowards, or maybe more accurately, a little known Japanese animation called Ringing Bell. It’s the tale of a sheep who goes on a quest to avenge his mother who was killed by a wolf, becoming a savage ram who has horns like spears and actually duels the wolf in the end. Highly recommended, but I digress. You know what could’ve helped out our woodland friends? An enter-the-battlefield trigger. Which is precisely what we’re looking for. Offspring’s Revenge is an excellent way to rebuy ETBs and attack triggers since it gives our vengeful babies haste. The glaring downside of the tokens being 1/1’s is no longer so much of an issue if we can maximize these two types of triggers to our advantage. I did a LOT of research for this article and let’s just say that there is a ridiculous number of creatures in standard with ETBs (and a fair amount with attack triggers too). Overcome with options and ideas, I figured we would have our cake and eat it too and I prepare a buffet of decks to choose from: A dedicated Offspring’s Revenge deck that’s extra hateful A take on a known standard deck, Mono-Black, utilizing Offspring’s Revenge , and A five color pile that pushes the boundaries of what we can reanimate (and the boundaries of functional deck building) Revenge is a Dish Best Served … Not cold. No, we want it flaming hot, so we’re serving up some burn. And the king of burn in this Standard format is the big three-headed dragon himself Drakuseth, Maw of flames . Drakuseth costs a fat seven mana, so instead of paying mana like an honest spellslinger let’s reanimate the big scaly bastard. Oh, and he has haste, so we’ll be dealing three and three and four, immediately. Drakuseth is great for gunning down our opponents creatures, whether that’s blockers, utility, or ones who’ll crack back at us. Drakuseth’s molten buddy tectonic giant is also joining the fray. It can go to our opponents dome on attack and is fine to be played out normally. Then, it can be recycled later after biting the dust for maximum value. Plus, the card advantage on tectonic giant ’s other attack trigger is underrated and recommended in games where your momentum is slowing. Like I mentioned earlier, the creatures we’re “reanimating” with Offspring’s Revenge are 1/1’s so we need a way to limit our opponents ability to go over us. One way to do that is if they don’t have any cards to play! (Yup, that math checks out - Chev) Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger and Basilica Bell Haunt both strip resources from our opponent and put us ahead on life totals. Like Tectonic Giant , both want to be run out early and then re-utilized later in the game. Kroxa especially, as it’ll put itself right in the graveyard for us. Keep in mind Kroxa will sacrifice itself if we get it with Offspring’s Revenge so escaping it can be favorable as well. Another way to maintain our onslaught is by blowing up our opponent’s stuff (duh, that’s like magic 101 Jules). Cavalier of Dawn and his friend Cavalier of Night are both happy to help. Dawn will pop any problematic noncreature permanents (say, a Teferi, Time Raveler ) and can easily tangle with the 3/3 left behind. Night will smite down any opposing fatties at the cost of one of our creatures, which we either want to recur anyway, or…. Is a 1/1 token that we already got a trigger off. Acceptable losses. Finally comes Plaguecrafter , a catch-all answer that can pick off a creature, planeswalker, or take another card out of our opponents hand. Also, since we’ll usually be sacrificing Plaguecrafter to his own trigger, he’s immediately ready for us to use again from the grave, similar to Kroxa. These are all great targets for our centerpiece enchantment, but most of these cards won’t get to the graveyard on their own! The gasoline to fuel our revengine (see what I did there?) comes in the form of classic red rummaging. Cathartic Reunion and Thrill of Possibility are both instant includes, filling our graveyard with targets and improving the consistency of our draws. Heartwarming Redemption is a one-sided pseudo- Windfall that I’ve been dying to try out (oh, that’s darkly ironic if you know the lore). Ox of Agonas is similar to redemption, just stapled to a body that can recur itself to provide extra gas late-game if we don’t have an Offspring’s Revenge . And you know what they say, you mess with the ox-spring, you get the flaming horns. And that’s pretty much the first version of this deck! Play card-draw spells to fill our yard and find revenges while stalling. Deal incidental damage with our smaller creatures until our more impactful ones touch down or their babies come for revenge. I’ve added some sweepers to ensure we don’t get totally run over with awkward draws. Some potential inclusions that caught my eye while building were Lotleth Giant , Angelic Guardian , and Underworld Sentinel . These can obviously be tweaked a bit depending on playstyle and this deck could probably use a bit more recursion, maybe something like a Corpse Churn just to provide more longevity. The build also doesn’t particularly like graveyard hate, but I haven’t seen Ashiok, Dream Render in a while and General Kudro of Drannith doesn’t seem to be seeing much play. The only drink that can pair perfectly with this manifestation of revenge is something that has aged just as finely. I recommend a barrel-aged beer such as Founders’ Dirty Bastard, a scotch style ale. Vroom Vroom, the Revengine Comes Enchantments 4x Offspring&#39;s Revenge Creatures 4x Basilica Bell-Haunt 2x Cavalier of Dawn 3x Cavalier of Night 4x Drakuseth, Maw of Flames 4x Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger 2x Ox of Agonas 3x Plaguecrafter Instants 2x Heartwarming Redemption 3x Thrill of Possibility Sorceries 4x Cathartic Reunion 3x Shatter the Sky Lands 4x Blood Crypt 4x Fabled Passage 4x Godless Shrine 3x Mountain 1x Plains 4x Sacred Foundry 3x Swamp All Black E’rythang Mono-Black has been a fairly powerful deck over the past few standard formats undergoing various transformations, but it’s recently fallen to the wayside. I think a little splash of blood and thunder is exactly what the deck needs to come back with a vengeance. Mono-Black is not a complicated deck. It wants to curve out; one-drop, two-drop, red-fish, blue-fish, Gray Merchant of Asphodel . My personal favorite sequence is Knight of the Ebon Legion , Yarok’s Fenlurker , Ayara, First of Locthwain , Nightmare Shepherd , and then of course… Gary. Gary is often the final nail in the coffin for opposing decks and mono-black likes to leverage him as much as possible. With the release of Theros Beyond Death, Nightmare shepherd was immediately slotted in to get additional Gary triggers. And now with Ikoria, we get Nightmare Shepherd copies five through eight with lots of upside in Offspring’s Revenge . Revenge give this linear deck options. Things are never truly dead and everything serves double duty. We’re running Cauldron Familiar / Witch’s Oven , because why not, and also Woe Strider . Both sac outlets just fuel our revenge when we need a boost. Besides getting a mini Gary to drain for a million, my personal favorite interaction is with Ayara, First of Locthwain . Every turn with offspring’s revenge out is a drain for one, a free block, and an extra card drawn. This deck’s shell is already pretty set, so after adding Offspring’s Revenge , the only real flex slots I had I gave to Lurrus of the Dream-Den because he gives us even more redundancy and he’s so prominent in every format nowadays. If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Some other potential choices are Rankle, Master of Pranks , Tymaret, Chosen From Death , or removal a la Murderous Rider . I recommend pairing something dark to drink with this deck. An Imperial stout such as Victory’s Storm King has a hefty weight to it and will warm up your icy soul. Or you could take a page out of our Queen Ayara’s playbook and settle with a dark, dry, red wine… or is that blood? Uh … n-nevermind. Not Even Light Can Escape the Blackhole of My Revenge Creatures 4x Ayara, First of Locthwain 4x Cauldron Familiar 4x Gray Merchant of Asphodel 4x Knight of the Ebon Legion 2x Lurrus of the Dream-Den 4x Nightmare Shepherd 4x Woe Strider 4x Yarok&#39;s Fenlurker Artifacts 4x Witch&#39;s Oven Enchantments 4x Offspring&#39;s Revenge Lands 4x Blood Crypt 4x Godless Shrine 10x Swamp 2x Temple of Malice 2x Temple of Silence 50 Shades of Revenge Standard right now is an absolute wonderland when it comes to mana. We have ridiculous color pair support from Return to Return to Ravnica block, complimented by the full set of temples finished in Theros Beyond Death. And we also have shard support and the triomes from Ikoria. Even Throne of Eldraine gave us a crucial mana fixer in Fabled Passage ! So, when the world is our oyster, why would we limit our revenge to merely three colors? Yes. I’m talking a full rainbow of revenge. As I mentioned earlier in the article, when I was researching for this article, I looked at any creature that we could recur, so any creature that has red, white, or black in it, but including any of the other colors. There are a lot of interesting and powerful creatures once you open up your color combos, and since I want to play all of them, this deck has a toolbox sensibility. We’re even using Yorion, Sky Nomad as our companion for value and as an excuse to run even more spice. It also means the mana is ridiculous, but we’ll take it for the few times we really go off. You probably get the gist of what’s up regarding Offspring’s Revenge by now, so I’ll just give you the decklist and you can see this monstrosity unfold for yourself. Also, drink whatever you want with this one, all rules and allegiances have been thrown out the window. Please forgive me for my sins. Vengeance in Technicolor Companion Yorion, Sky Nomad Creatures 3x Atris, Oracle of Half-Truths 2x Deputy of Detention 1x Drakuseth, Maw of Flames 4x Dream Trawler 3x Elite Guardmage 1x God-Eternal Bontu 2x Golgari Findbroker 4x Gravebreaker Lamia 1x Ilharg, the Raze-Boar 2x Knight of Autumn 2x Massacre Girl 2x Polukranos, Unchained 2x Rakdos, the Showstopper Instants 3x Thirst for Meaning Lands 4x Blood Crypt 2x Fabled Passage 4x Godless Shrine 2x Hallowed Fountain 4x Indatha Triome 1x Island 3x Ketria Triome 1x Mountain 1x Plains 4x Raugrin Triome 4x Savai Triome 1x Steam Vents 1x Swamp Enchantments 4x Fires of Invention 4x Offspring&#39;s Revenge Sorceries 4x Cathartic Reunion 2x Idyllic Tutor 3x Shatter the Sky That’s all for now folks! I had stupid amounts of fun brewing these deck and I think we’re only scratching the surface on Offspring’s Revenge ! During the brewing process I had ideas for a mono-red deck with a goblin theme, think Krenko, Tinstreet Kingpin , Goblin Ringleader , etc. or a Boros deck utilizing the life gain cores of past Standards ( Alseid of Life’s Bounty , Ajani’s Pridemate , Linden, the Steadfast Queen ) with beaters like Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice . Okay, I need to stop, y’all already got three lists in this article. But that’s the greatness of finding a sweet card to brew around; the possibilities are endless, but you want to find them all.! So, until next week, kick back, pop a cold one, and stay brewing y’all!

Don’t let him fool you&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of those we’re going to focus on brews that are relatively easy to put together with either some time in standard or a fair number of drafts under your belt. Let’s get right into it!&lt;/p&gt; Belle of the Brawl Today we’re going to start by going back in time three months. Before companions ruled the Earth…before Godzilla became an actual card. Before…Corona (and not the beer). It was a simpler time, my friend Oakley and I were getting our butts handed to us by a father and his nine year old son in a 2HG prerelease. (Actually come to think of it, I feel like a lot of my Brawl memories come from being trounced at prereleases…) Anyway the event was a bust, but I had opened a Siona, Captain of the Pyleas and had started imagining what a Selesnya commander deck would look like with her at the helm, leading an army of heavily auraed forces to victory against legions of foes. Pretty neat right? Not only are you getting value as soon as Siona hits the battlefield, being able to “tutor” for a useful aura but also enabling a token sub strategy is not a bad plan B. The cost of throwing an Intangible Virtue or an Anointed Procession into a 99-card deck isn’t too high and considering they’d also enable more enchantment shenanigans…anyway. Right now you’re probably thinking “Chev, come on. Everyone does commander deck techs. Give me that good good BRAWWWL!” And I’d say, “Hold on, eager reader, we’re getting there.” So I started scheming, and a plan started to form…way too quickly. You see, I couldn’t get my mind out of this rut that after needing to throw in the package of the most powerful auras ( Eldrazi Conscription , Darksteel Mutation , Gift of Immortality ), and the ramp package to be able to play the bigger auras and the consistency of a turn-two Siona… I found much less room for creativity than I would have liked. Some of this could be an amount of creative burnout being fresh off a stint of upgrading most of my other commander decks - maybe Siona was just schemed at the wrong time - but it gave me the glimmer of an idea that you’re about to see the results of. What about putting together a Selesnya aura brawl deck? The restricted cardpool could really be a boon to the creativity required, and enable us to have a more unique experience with oh captain our captain. Enough talk though, let’s tech. Offensive Line We’ve got a pretty impressive lineup available thanks to Theros’s heavy enchantment theme, and a couple powerful standouts from Ikoria and Eldraine. Let’s see the heaviest hitters: All that Glitters reminds me of my only foray into pauper using a build that centered around Slippery Bogle and Ethereal Armor . Unfortunately, trading first strike for growing off of artifacts is not really helpful for us here but being able to directly benefit from every aura and other enchantment we play is reason enough to include this. With any luck, the high number of other auras and enchantment creatures will let this serve as a cheaper copy of our next highlight… Colossification I mean damn, there’s not really much to be said for an aura that hands out +20/+20 besides I hope we can get it on something with trample. It’ll be interesting to see how often this is actually allowed to come down or put in work since the rest of our curve is relatively low. But in the event of a long game, having this big a finisher in your corner ain’t bad. Hydra’s Growth trades Colossification’s significant mana cost for a time investment, being able to easily reach and surpass +20/+20 in the more durable form of +1/+1 counters, but taking a few turns to get there. Hydra’s growth has been an absolute powerhouse in every limited deck I made during the THB season and it’ll be interesting to see how this shapes up in Brawl. I personally think it’ll become a kill on-sight card which is certainly nice to draw attention if we’ve got anything else we need a distraction from. Warbriar Blessing is one of our few forms of removal. White certainly doesn’t have the suite of cheap removal available to it in eternal formats, and besides a couple higher cost instants this might be one of the best chances to stay on theme and pop one of our opponent’s creatures. We’ll see if the benefits outweigh the costs though… But of course, what good are all-star auras without all-star targets to enchant? We need a strong creature base to support our theme and I think these guys have what it takes to go pro: Archon of Sun’s Grace could stand on its own as a 3/4 flyer with lifelink for 4 as a potential target to drop a Colossification on, but add on the Constellation trigger to create MORE flyers with lifelink? What?! It’s like…that’s our strategy or something! Anyway you’ll never be disappointed by drawing this card, at any point in the game. Paradise Druid is a great example of what I consider a long-term investment. Upfront, it can give you a lil mana, get you dropping threats early, but later….you’ve got a creature with conditional hexproof. While you still need to navigate around its loss of hexproof on tap, there’s a lot to be said for equipping Paradise Druid with Sentinel’s Eyes and any other enchantment in your deck to build your own hexproof threat. Just be careful and remember Colossification taps your creature, which would render Paradise Druid vulnerable for a turn. Lavabrink Venturer takes what makes Paradise Druid good and turns it to 11… conditionally. Remember that Protection also protects Lavabrink from your stuff so be incredibly careful about choosing Odd, since that’ll prevent it from being a target of either Colossification, Hydra’s Growth, or Sentinel’s Eyes. Just something to consider. Either way, still incredibly powerful if you have the wildcard to spend. Setessan Champion is what I’d call an undeniable team player. Regardless of who gets the aura you’re playing, Setessan Champion still gets a +1/+1 counter AND draws you a card. That’s some incredible value on a 3-drop, especially considering they’ll also trigger on any enchantment creature or other enchantment you’re playing. Green and White are not known for their card draw, so a repeatable draw engine that also plays along with our deck theme is something I’d even consider in a Siona commander build. Defense As much as I’d love to wage an all-out assault of auras, we do need to be prepared for the inevitable: our opponent will want to play creatures and stuff as much as we do. This is where the second type of aura in our deck comes in. Trapped in the Tower, while conditional, is really worth the two mana. It won’t be able to hit any form of Niv-Mizzet, but clamping down on an indestructible God or any other beast without wings is of incredible benefit. It also has the clause negating activated abilities which puts this over Pacifism in my book. Kenrith’s Transformation is the latest in a long line of such transformations that I had thought were supposed to be in Blue’s part of the color pie. It’s not as powerful as Song of the Dryads or Imprisoned in the Moon , but is still incredibly useful at stopping a threat. It even replaces itself! While testing the deck I did manage to cast this on Kenrith himself, so, that was a huge flavor win. Heliod’s Punishment sneaks in over Dreadful Apathy for a similar reason of Trapped in the Tower over pacifism: the stifling of annoying abilities. Does it have a four turn clock? Sure, but hopefully you’ll get something else by then. While Dreadful Apathy can deal with the threat more permanently at six mana, I’ll gladly take this trade. Especially when targeting a commander who they’d potentially be able to replay if it weren’t stuck on the battlefield. Non-Aura Removal We have several powerful reasons to utilize auras (mainly Siona), but sometimes we need to rid ourselves of a threat more permanently. That’s when we bring in the closers. Banishing Light is incredibly potent and the effect of triggering all the Constellation abilities as well as boosting All that glitters makes this a no brainer. For when trapping Chulane, teller of tales in a tower isn’t enough, try banishing it to the shadow realm. Calix, Destiny’s Hand works as a great enchantment engine, serving as a relatively repeatable mini Siona trigger. This is mostly upside though as his inclusion is frankly due to the power of his minus. Being able to repeatedly Oblivion Ring is no small feat, and having a second copy of Banishing light really helps with consistency. Also, if you’re playing any of the Theros Gods - putting a card underneath Heliod, Sun-Crowned is nigh unbreakable…unless you’re that one jerk I found running Barrier Breach . Swallow Whole might be the closest we get to a straight up Swords to Plowshares in Standard and I believe it should be recognized as such. There are hoops to go through, and it won’t be able to kill everything but having that ability at one mana and a creature will come in handy more often than not. Going Tall and Wide While we don’t plan to spend too much energy on Siona’s secondary ability, I do believe a few cards make their inclusion well justified, and help serve as a potential backup plan when all else fails. Commanding Presence doubles as a pretty powerful aura granting a boost and first strike, this can easily make a dent in defenses, but really shines when paired with the next highlighted card. Divine Visitation is one powerful card. Not only could you be getting an angel for every aura you play with Siona on the field, but even if they’re removed you still reap the benefits from both Commanding Presence, and the previously mentioned Archon of Sun’s Grace . Plenty of opportunities to fill the board with 4/4 angels by doing what you already planned on doing. Everything else included serves mostly to support these bigger themes or protect our investments. Things like Veil of Summer and Unbreakable Formation keep our creatures alive, while Starfield Mystic and Transcendent Envoy make our enchantments cheaper. There are also a couple more high power creatures like Questing Beast but these can really be substituted with whatever bonkers aura-targets you have lying around in a pinch. Here’s the final list! Siona, Captain of the Pyleas Auras Creatures 1x Alseid of Life&#39;s Bounty 1x Archon of Sun&#39;s Grace 1x Destiny Spinner 1x Faeburrow Elder 1x Gilded Goose 1x Heliod, Sun-Crowned 1x Ilysian Caryatid 1x Knight of Autumn 1x Lavabrink Venturer 1x Luminous Broodmoth 1x Paradise Druid 1x Questing Beast 1x Setessan Champion 1x Starfield Mystic 1x Transcendent Envoy Lands 1x Blossoming Sands 1x Command Tower 1x Fabled Passage 9x Forest 9x Plains 1x Temple Garden 1x Temple of Plenty Enchantments 1x All that Glitters 1x Angelic Gift 1x Banishing Light 1x Colossification 1x Commanding Presence 1x Divine Visitation 1x Elspeth Conquers Death 1x Heliod&#39;s Punishment 1x Hydra&#39;s Growth 1x Kenrith&#39;s Transformation 1x New Horizons 1x Omen of the Hunt 1x Sentinel&#39;s Eyes 1x Trapped in the Tower 1x Warbriar Blessing 1x Wolfwillow Haven Instants 1x Karametra&#39;s Blessing 1x Unbreakable Formation 1x Veil of Summer Sorceries 1x Swallow Whole Planeswalkers 1x Calix, Destiny&#39;s Hand Results Out of the 7 matches we played with Siona, we went 5 and 2. Siona was able to successfully ramp and limit the threat of Niv Mizzet, Reborn and Kenrith, the Returned King quite easily with those defensive enchantments while also turning Paradise Druid into an absolute wrecking ball of All that Glitters and Sentinel’s Eyes in both games!! Others against Brokkos, Apex of Forever , Niv-Mizzet, Parun , and Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath followed similar trajectories being able to render an entire stack of mutated creatures inert while Brokkos was in the pile, or keeping Niv-MIzzet stuck to pinging as opposed to also being a flying 6/6. The two games lost partly involved Dreadful Apathy in place of Heliod’s Punishment . In the earlier build of this deck, I favored the more costly total removal over simply rendering a commander unuseable which proved useless against Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy . The second game we just got beat, the Winota, Joiner of Forces deck we were up against played fast and hard - in fact the player was so confident in their ability, they said good game as soon as they played Winota. What a champ. Overall, I think the deck has a lot of potential and is definitely something to play if you’re looking for a unique Brawl experience in the current meta. For a total of 12 Rares and 5 Mythics, you’re looking at a pretty consistent construction. Comparatively, That would get you half a manabase and one set of Uros in Standard! (also 2 of those rares are for Faeburrow Elder and Gilded Goose which could easily be swapped with Incubation Druid and Leafkin Druid if you’re on a budget) Enter The Guildhall &lt;p&gt;Brawl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Siona and the Argonauts (Brawl)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;searchResult/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/05/14/brawldt_1.html&quot; class=&quot;searchResultSnippet&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;titan&#39;s nest (standard)&quot; class=&quot;result width-full&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link width-full&quot; href=&quot;/rev%20your%20engines/2020/05/11/rye_1.html&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;crop-contain&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.scryfall.com/cards/art_crop/front/7/5/75d4e6f3-73cb-4799-bcb9-c1f5bc234a02.jpg?1586521298&quot; class=&quot;author-post&quot; alt=&quot;Titan&#39;s Nest (Standard)&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4 class=&quot;post-category&quot;&gt;Rev Your Engines&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postContent&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every set Wizards teases us with these niche, often rare or mythic, enchantments, that just scream to be built around. These cards can be the core engines of decks that rack up mana and card advantage turn after turn to bury the opponent and allow for explosive kill turns…. or, often, they fall overlooked, misunderstood, and forgotten, unable to compete with the raw efficiency of modern card design.&lt;/p&gt; In Standard, you can look to Wilderness Reclamation and Fires of Invention (two of the best decks currently), but several other enchantments lay in wait in standard that haven’t quite seen their day. Cards like Underworld Breach and Doom Foretold had brief stints in the limelight, but gems like Firemind’s Research , Enigmatic Incarnation , or Happily Ever After (a man can dream, okay?) have seen love only on the fringes, if at all. Ikoria is no different, with a bevy of incredibly spicy and seemingly powerful enchantments. The ones I’m eyeing currently are the rare shard enchantments and we’re kicking off this series with a real doozey in Titan&#39;s Nest ! Welcome to Rev Your Engines, the series where we utilize unique engine enchantments to kick standard into high gear! Will we have a highly tuned engine to take us across the finish line or will we sputter and stall out? (I simultaneously hated and loved making those puns) A Wretched Hive of Scum and Villiany With the right build, Titan’s Nest falls firmly in the “busted” category and I think it could be a major player in standard once rotation comes in the fall. Just reading the card, we essentially give all our spells delve (a mechanic that has gotten cards banned in many formats). Yes, there are some restrictions, no X-spells, only mono-colored spells, but Hydroid Krasis and Expansion//Explosion are too mainstream anyway. Titan’s Nest is also full on Sultai (hooray for the return of wedge support), colors that happen to love putting milling themselves for all sorts of benefit. On the surface, this enchantment can turn our graveyard into a source of ramp to keep our foot on the gas in the mid to late game. But that’s boring. Like I said earlier, this enchantment should not be treated as a fair card, and I intend to use it solely for the forces of evil. And the dastardly villain who has made the Titan’s Nest his lair is none other than Syr Konrad, the Grim . We’re Dealing With a Real Maniac… Syr Konrad was a powerhouse in Throne of Eldraine limited, but in constructed formats he’s been generally overlooked. Some of that might be because he has more lines of text than War and Peace… or more likely because he was turned into an elk. TLDR, any time creatures are entering or leaving the graveyard, Syr Konrad is gonna ping our opponent. They want to wrath, they&#39;ll take a bunch of damage. They mill some of our beloved troops, they get pinged a few times. If creatures are banished to the shadow realm (whoops wrong card game) by Titan’s Nest to generate loads of colorless mana…. they take damage for Every. Single. One. That is our dastardly scheme in a nutshell: mill as much of our deck as possible, get a Syr Konrad and Titan’s Nest on the field and huck a putrid fireball from beyond the grave. Bring in the Minions So, what poor saps have been enlisted as Konrad’s minions to be sent to their inevitable unceremonious demise? Syr Konrad doesn’t discriminate. Merfolk, Bird, Gorgon… Wall? He’ll take every helping hand/fin/brick he can get. The common thread among this creature suite is that all these creatures mill us, fueling our Nest and triggering Konrad if he’s out. We’re looking at three to four cards binned per creature we play which adds up very quickly. While there are cards that could self-mill more efficiently in standard, we need a high density of creatures to enact our combo kill. These creatures all come with upside in that they pad our life total or block incredibly well. Gorging Vulture and Mire Triton both boost our life enough to get us that extra turn we need to assemble our combo. Venomous Hierophant and Mire Triton both have deathtouch which is a big deterrent, especially for larger creatures that will outclass our motley crew of recruits. Wall of Lost Thoughts and Merfolk Secretkeeper have big butts to hold back small creatures chipping in, and Glowspore Shaman often trades up. Also, we are not afraid to chump block or take an early trade! It only fuels us once it comes time to go off. Every Super Villian Needs Some Villianous Tools Our non-creature suite is trim, but supports and adds consistency to our gameplan. I like Tamiyo, Collector of Tales a lot. It’s a versatile card, especially with graveyard strategies. It can dig for our combo pieces, milling us more in the process, or regrow things that we milled earlier. We don’t want to dilute our creature count and at four mana, it’s on the higher end of our curve, but I thought trying one out could be interesting. Corpse churn , an Ikoria reprint, is an auto-include. It mills us and can grab a Syr Konrad we milled or just any other fallen soldier to keep the mill train rolling. Once again, this consistency and ability to maintain momentum is important for a combo deck like ours. The Binding of the Titans was a card that intrigued me at release, but never really found a home in any of my decks until now. Given, it takes some turns, but this card is a powerhouse for us. It mills us, it gains life and allows us to pick off a lurking Uro, Titan of Nature&#39;s Wrath or Lurrus of the Dream-Den target. Nice. In chapter three we even get to fix our mana or, like Corpse Churn, get back a creature we may need or our fearless leader, Syr Konrad. And then after all that, we can exile the Binding to our Titan’s Nest to play our other spells. Tymaret Calls the Dead as a one-of is just a catch-all slot. It mills more than our other cards, albeit over multiple turns, gains us some life at the end, and if you can exile an already spent Binding, we can get an additional blocker (or attacker if our opponent is playing a creature-light deck). The mana base is mostly basics, just to keep it simple. We want to be going as fast as possible, we cannot wait for tap lands. Add a few shocks and Fabled Passage s to fix and season to taste. The Scheme is Foolproof! The plan is simple, mill yourself as fast possible. Use as much or all of your mana every turn and get those cards in your graveyard. Always keep a track of how many creatures are in there so you know when you’ve reached critical mass. Also, keep track of where your Konrads and Nests are. We need those to win the game, so if you get a chance to nab one back from the yard, get it. As you’re playing your creatures out, block aggressively. We want to conserve our life total as best we can, and we lose nothing from an additional creature in the bin. Also, don’t be afraid to attack! Getting chip-ins is critical to lessening the threshold needed for Konrad to do his thing. Most of our creatures attack well, so get in there if it’s free. Unfortunately, this deck comes with some drawbacks, so let’s discuss what might endanger our victory. Like most combo decks, this deck is incredibly linear and there’s no real interaction for us besides blocking, so a counterspell can hinder us. Also, any sort of exile really hurts. Elspeth Conquers Death hits both our main pieces and something like Elspeth’s Nightmare is a nightmare for us as well wiping out all the progress we’ve made. Sometimes we just won’t draw Titan’s Nest and Syr Konrad, or we’ll mill them. Lastly, we realistically can’t deal much more than twenty damage, so any deck that has lots of life gain can be a problem. But these are issues that plague all but the most resilient of combo decks and they’re risks that we’ll take to play this ridiculous yet beautiful brew. On the flip-side, this deck is not a tier deck. Opponents won’t see their demise coming until it’s too late. And since our pseudo delve is a mana ability, they can’t stop it and we can do everything immediately at instant speed! There’s nothing like stacking up 20 Syr Konrad triggers up and letting them machine-gun down our bewildered opponent. If you ever go to play this deck yourself, I recommend cracking open a nice sour beer. Konrad is truly EVIL (&quot;Every Villian is Lemons&quot;) plotting in the Titan&#39;s Nest, and lemons are quite sour. Two of my favorites are Druthers&#39; Dare and Dogfish Head&#39;s Seaquench. Here’s the full list for all your copying pleasure, or you can check out our tappedout link to see any of our decks past, present, or future.

We’re incredibly excited to announce the launch of a brand new platform chock full of incredible Magic the Gathering content brought to you by some of the freshest voices in Magic. This is our first time doing anything of the sort, so we’re basically fresh off the boat.&lt;/p&gt; A Lil’ History Lesson Our playgroup was founded in 2015, narrowly avoiding a fate of Yu-Gi-Oh thanks to some quick thinking by the proprietor of a local game shop. Since then, Magic has become a way for us to stay together and continue to foster a friendship that has since endured through our college experiences and continues to develop as we enter into the professional world and our adult lives. What’s Our Angle? For us, Magic has always been a force inspiring unity. Spending each school break when we’re all together whipping out new and exciting builds for a night of Commander, drinking beer and swapping stories. Or driving across state lines to meet up for midnight prereleases. There are endless tales like this for us, as I’m sure there are for many of you.We want to share those experiences and memories with you and hear yours, all while toasting our favorite beverages. Countless outlets exist to get every type of Magic fix available. MTGGoldfish, MTGStocks, TCGPlayer, Scryfall, CoolStuffInc, and Hipsters of the Coast all provide great content. We enjoy serving up competitive analysis and meta discussion, but we also want to provide a window into how we experience magic and how it has been an outlet of creativity for us. We found that magic is not only a game, but a way to communicate. It could be explaining your incredibly convoluted and “totally tier 1” combo you assembled to your friends around the kitchen table, or just discussing all the hot spoilers that’ll slot into your commander decks around the campfire. These holistic experiences that most people would tell you are their favorite memories of the game should be shared with joy: and we want to bring that to all of you. Best Commanders to play during a night of drinking? How is crafting a deck like making Homebrew? Which of our decks have aged like fine wines and which went down the hatch quick like a shot of bottom tier vodka. Every game and every card has its own story. We’d love for you to join us in recanting this all. Grab a drink and shuffle up! Meet our Founders: Chev Eldrid - Having just completed a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Chev is eager to develop his skills in both software development and Magic content creation. He’ll be bringing you content on Brawl, Commander, and some streaming in the upcoming weeks with a couple series soon to be announced. Chev is probably also responsible for anything broken on the site so he’s the person to contact for that. Julian Leal - A recent graduate of the University of Maryland, Julian has spent the last year developing his professional career as a Geologist. Though he’s most at home playing Commander, Julian has also spent this time striving to branch into all other constructed formats and brewing around anything and everything. Expect brews and competitive decks in Standard, a delve into Historic, and the occasional foray into limited (plus whatever other debauchery he can sneak past Chev). Julian will also be streaming, hopefully regularly. Thanks for stopping by! I know we look small now but I promise, we’re just getting started.

                                <p>….and just like that, we’re back! <em>Historically Speaking</em> returns with the second half of my Historic metagame analysis, this time discussing the main “midrange” and control decks in the format. For those of you just joining me, welcome! Check out part 1 of this analysis where I cover aggro and tribal decks, <a href="https://hexdrinkers.com/historically%20speaking/2020/09/09/historic2-1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Same as before, I’ve broken down the decks under these broader archetypes. I’ll only be covering the most prominent decks in the meta, we’ll save the brewing for later <em>wink wink</em>. So without further adieu, let’s finish our grand tour!

<h2 id="midrange-decks">“Midrange” Decks</h2>
<p><br />
Midrange is a contentious term nowadays, with recent pushes in power seemingly squeezing it out of most formats, especially recent Standards. However, I’m using it to refer to decks that don’t go as low and fast as the aggro (or tribal) decks and are more proactive than the control decks we’ll discuss later.</p>

<p>This deck represents a few different strands of a powerful sacrifice core.

	Bolas’s Citadel
</a>. In general they’re Golgari, though some versions move towards Abzan, some towards Jund. Don’t worry if this sounds like a lot, we’ll go into the unique flavors of this build a little later but for right now let’s talk about the foundation they all have in common.

	Blood Artist
</a>, among others. In their purest essence, these decks want to churn through their libraries using sacrifice value and eventually drain their opponents out with a <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/206/blood-artist?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/4/6/465d8c18-c76b-488a-a4ec-ec0d2267a307.jpg?1592706389' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

</a> effect. Woe Strider is another integral piece, providing a <strong>free</strong> sacrifice outlet which is absolutely key, giving you a goat to get the engines started, and can recur itself if you run out of gas. It also allows you to scry with each sacrifice as well which keeps the gas rolling, especially for <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/79/bolass-citadel?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/2/d2124603-d20e-40eb-97f0-a66323397ac2.jpg?1591205069' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Phyrexian Tower
</a> is a powerful <em>Magic</em> Card.
The other all star of this deck is <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/rna/83/priest-of-forgotten-gods?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/e/3/e3378fe8-3355-48aa-90d4-9cb739200160.jpg?1584830686' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Priest of Forgotten Gods
</a>. It’s key in removing opposing creatures, especially something out of the Auras deck, or a lone <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/24/muxus-goblin-grandee?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/2/c/2c716d10-2130-43b7-a939-349d437e1091.jpg?1592705417' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Muxus, Goblin Grandee
</a> with the trigger on the stack. If you can get a Priest and some fodder out early, you can often keep your opponent off creatures for several turns, giving you the time you need to assemble your engine or just beat down. Lastly, the Priest draws (always good) and that double black mana boost can help on key multi-spell turns or for powering out a Citadel.

</a>. These ramp/fix you and also are prime sacrifice fodder when you need to get down to brass tacks.

</a>. Much like <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/24/muxus-goblin-grandee?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/2/c/2c716d10-2130-43b7-a939-349d437e1091.jpg?1592705417' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Muxus, Goblin Grandee
</a> in Goblins, Citadel is the “I Win” card in Golgari Sac. With the draining effects of something like <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/206/blood-artist?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/4/6/465d8c18-c76b-488a-a4ec-ec0d2267a307.jpg?1592706389' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Blood Artist
</a> and low average CMC, you can tear through the top of your deck with little concern for your life, scrying away lands with <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/123/woe-strider?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/3/4/3457b558-b35b-49fd-b499-b1ec755f86ce.jpg?1581480044' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Woe Strider
</a>. Dump enough creatures onto the board and sacrifice them for a machine gun effect to decimate your opponent’s life total. Sometimes you won’t be able to pull off the full combo and close out the game, but you’ll often be able to establish a healthy board presence and set up for a kill next turn.

<h4 id="variations-on-a-sacrificial-theme">Variations on a (Sacrificial) Theme</h4>

<p>Now that we’ve discussed the basics of the deck, let’s hit on the different flavors real quick. Golgari is of course the most straightforward. They get to run all the dorks, a full four-of <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/79/bolass-citadel?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/2/d2124603-d20e-40eb-97f0-a66323397ac2.jpg?1591205069' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Bastion of Remembrance

	Blood Artist
</a> for drain. They also get some flex slots where you might put a <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/179/jadelight-ranger?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/3/b/3b945b4d-5240-4779-9187-e3b18903bf59.jpg?1599765852' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Nightmare Shepherd
</a>. This version is clean and tuned. It won’t have mana problems and it wants to bust out a Citadel as soon as possible to go off. Simple and effective, but its Company hits are the weakest on average and most importantly it isn’t … <em>flashy</em>.

<p>Lastly, there are Abzan versions. These are probably my least favorite as they don’t gain enough for the mana inconsistency.

This deck is one of the most versatile in the meta and can take several different lines depending on the opponent. However, similar to Elves from pt 1, it can falter when you draw the wrong half of your deck. All mana dorks does you no good, and only having your payoffs won’t let you establish your engine as you’re sacrificing everything.</p>

<p>Also, the “randomness” of your most powerful engines, <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/dtk/177/collected-company?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/c/f/cfa7b456-7e83-4587-a875-9b35fde318c2.jpg?1582117536' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Bolas’s Citadel
</a> can cause you to miss or stall out and that can often prove fatal. Too many times I’ve gotten my opponent down to two or three life and then hit double lands off the top with Citadel. Just as many times, I’ve needed a reasonable Company to retake board dominance and fuel a Priest, and I hit… a single measly <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m19/314/llanowar-elves?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/7/3/73542493-cd0b-4bb7-a5b8-8f889c76e4d6.jpg?1562302708' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

And of course, any quick deck with good spot-removal can take out your key pieces (Strider, Priest, Devil) as you’re setting up and totally halt any progress. That being said, the raw power of your pieces and the adaptability of the deck will truly reward dedicated and detail-oriented play.

<p><strong>Much</strong> less complicated than the previous set of decks, Gruul probably shouldn’t even be considered a midrange deck. A statement to how powerful aggro is in this format, Gruul is merely a midrange deck because it goes bigger and is a bit more resilient than your typical aggro deck.</p>

<p>Shockingly similar to Gruul aggro/midrange in Standard (did you know they printed powerful cards this last year?) it often curves <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/grn/141/pelt-collector?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/b/e/bee125cb-12b9-4f78-8e1d-6018d9c52275.jpg?1572893427' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

Most of these cards don’t need any explaining, they’re just big and good at attacking. I will break down some of the more important ones though:</p>

	Questing Beast
</a> continues to be a thorn in many players’ side, just like in Standard, and with the presence of a lot of low to the ground creature decks is usually unblockable. Chipping in for a free four damage a turn with vigilance to wall most things in the format is nasty.</p>

	Primal Might
</a>. At worst it’s a one mana fight spell, which since your creatures are all huge, is just a straight up removal spell. But when the game is going long, you can pump up your creature to astronomical heights, remove their best blocker, and go to town. Add in trample from <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/akh/182/rhonas-the-indomitable?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/5/0/50f23c47-278c-4188-8fb4-ae20a0c423c5.jpg?1543675944' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

<p>The biggest thing this deck has going for it is the raw POWER of each of its cards. There isn’t really any synergy, just the most efficient threats, pound for pound.

<h2 id="control-decks">Control Decks</h2>
<p><br />
Lastly, but not leastly, ye olde control decks. My personal favorite archetype, I was disappointed with control’s place in the meta. With the prominence of aggro decks and midrange decks that could be considered aggro decks, it’s hard for control to maintain a home, and of those I’ll mention, I’d really only consider one a true control deck.

The thing that I don’t like about this deck is there aren’t really any good play patterns and there isn’t any real decision-making. All your cards are stupidly powerful and can grind your opponent into oblivion. If something gets removed or countered, you already have enough backup to brush it off. Stick one threat and it can easily close the game. The only real decision is the number of <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/246/languish?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/9/b/9b53ce1b-9353-42ad-89a0-36e907ba576a.jpg?1592706616' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

<p>A deck I don’t see super often on the ladder, Orzhov Yorion is one of the most interesting decks in the meta. It’s also one of the most fun to pilot and one of the most miserable to play against, but whatever.</p>

<p>Functioning around blinking powerful enchantments (and y’all know how much I love enchantments), this deck’s pinnacle is establishing a loop with <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/232/yorion-sky-nomad?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/2/7/275426c4-c14e-47d0-a9d4-24da7f6f6911.jpg?1591228496' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Charming Prince
</a> provides a way to rebuy your Yorions and if you can keep them both alive, they cycle in and out in a sort of lock to continually reset all your enchantments. The outcome? Your opponent has no permanents and no cards in hand. Nice.

</a>, both very powerful includes. They both do exactly what you want: removal and resource denial, whether that’s cards in hand, cards in graveyard, or taxing the opponent’s mana. Then, as the dust is clearing, you’ll get to reanimate a fallen Yorion to renew your opponent’s subscription to poundtown.</p>

	Doom Foretold
</a> is Trial or Eldest on steroids and won’t stop until your opponent <em>has</em> no permanents and that sacrifice trigger is the final nail in the coffin. Often the best option for an opponent who doesn’t have an abundance of nonland permanents already is to just sandbag and wait for the Foretold to pop, which gives us time to set up even more lock pieces and strip any chance of our opponent from winning, by playing something like a <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/ori/92/demonic-pact?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/8/2/82c04014-91f9-4197-b4b4-f62c4739a5c2.jpg?1562028673' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Demonic Pact
</a> does everything we could ever want. We can pick off creatures, refill our hand, and even more important in this deck, deny our opponents resources. Then before that pesky fourth choice comes around, we just blink it and get back to the sweet, sweet value. Or we cast <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/rna/171/final-payment?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/4/9/49a21a8f-9c7b-4ae8-8635-f2ee2151c8de.jpg?1584831505' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Final Payment
</a> and sacrifice it, another sweet line of tech. Either way, what I’m trying to say is demonic pacts are fun and don’t pose us a liability. Highly recommend.

The final part of this deck that I think is great is its customizability. Yes, I love enchantments, and there’s already plenty of great options, but if you want to go for a more creature-centric build you can! <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/269/ravenous-chupacabra?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/4/0/40d3e58e-f989-4169-9e2c-a66a23170dcf.jpg?1592706747' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Ravenous Chupacabra
</a> is a great addition to merk anything and everything while <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/214/burglar-rat?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/c/b/cb457c05-2a60-437a-8138-cfd581b22996.jpg?1592706434' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Burglar Rat
</a> provides your discard effect.</p>

<p>This deck can be slow to start and definitely demands more thought intensive lines of play, but the sheer off-the-wall construction of the deck, getting to play a deck essentially devoid of staples, and the utter domination that comes from pulling out a win with this deck is worth it.

<p>Finally, we’ve come to the end. My favorite deck in my favorite archetype. Good ol’ Azorius Draw-Go Control. The only true control deck in this article and pretty much the only tiered control deck in the meta, this harkons to the glory days of the archetype.</p>

<p>Rife with counterspells, removal, card advantage, and a noticeable lack of win-conditions, I love this deck. But it isn’t really that good. It’s inherently reactive by nature, counter/remove your opponent’s threats until they don’t have any. Then you can think about slowly winning through something like a <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/67/shark-typhoon?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/1/d/1da4d4f3-b3cb-4b61-81b8-06ae441c41bf.jpg?1591226502' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Teferi, Hero of Dominaria
</a> aka “Scourge of Dominaria Standard” tops off our deck. This is generally our best card and can run away with the game if we stick him. He does basically everything.</p>

<p>However, I think the sad truth is that this just isn’t enough anymore. Even with some of the best control cards ever printed, I don’t think trading one for one with the opponent is going to cut it in today’s format. Even with the best sideboard cards in the entire meta, being reactive instead of proactive often can’t compete. I’ll continue to play this deck cause I love it, but I wouldn’t take this to a tournament anytime soon.

                                <p>For the eager, here’s the <a href="https://www.moxfield.com/decks/7mYDtSUc7EiUS-9azXTWWA" target="_blank">decklist</a>! 
For the rest, here’s the breakdown!</p>

<p>There’s something wonderful about playing mono-color in commander. Nowadays there are so many “must-play” cards being added to the format (looking at you <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/c20/237/arcane-signet?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/1/4/1486170d-4ad3-4318-bf72-f948617d567f.jpg?1591321552' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Arcane Signet
</a>) that it can feel the more colors you play, the <em>less</em> room you have to add your commander’s unique package. Think about the infrastructure required to get a rainbow deck going compared to a color combination that’s less mana-taxing. Monocolor doesn’t exactly get rid of all the required cards, every color has them, but playing with less colors means there are fewer cards you feel compelled to play.</p>

<p>Of course there is a downside. Playing with only one color means you really are beholden to the restrictions of that color. Red can’t deal with enchantments, White doesn’t really draw cards, Green has a hard time losing games. Things have to be kept balanced! Joking aside, this week I want to take a look at my FAVORITE monocolor style, ever since I purchased the Sworn to Darkness C14 precon. Mono-black.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Homebrewed, it’s been a while. I have to fit article-writing in between relaxing on the beach and enjoying the California sun so it’s been tough you know? Don’t worry, it’ll be worth the wait, I promise.</p>

<p>As you might have picked up, The Hexdrinkers have been doing weekly game nights as a way to test out new strategies and build ideas in a real setting while also being able to stay close and of course, play Magic. The past couple weeks I’ve strayed from my typical rotation of Hapatra shenanigans, Eldrazi nonsense, and Coin-Flip insanity to a different deck: <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/bok/89/toshiro-umezawa?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/0/e/0e767e07-febd-4025-bf03-d4d816bc1d3d.jpg?1562875477' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

<p>This incredibly unique commander from Betrayers of Kamigawa (In fact, isn’t he THE Betrayer? I’ll have to check with Eric…) really encourages a unique playstyle for Black. I mean yes it’s wrapped in murdering as many creatures as possible, but you don’t often see Black reanimating anything but creatures. Focusing on instants gets you at LEAST double the murder mayhem. Plus, Black has some real surprise cards that’ll have people scratching their heads as to why they were allowed to exist.</p>

<p>You’ll love this deck if:
You’re a spellslinger trying to branch out of Izzet
You love having answers to your opponents’ nasty creatures 90% of the time
You like having multiple play avenues at any given time <strong>(Editor’s note: Don’t we all…?)</strong> 
You want to give green ramp a run for its money</p>

<p>Maybe this deck isn’t quite for you if:
You’re looking to take advantage of Black’s creature suite
You want the love and affection of anyone else at the table
You prefer a more linear playstyle. Well. Ish. Okay so it’s linear in the “kill a creature, re-cast a kill spell, kill another creature, until the mana runs dry” kinda way. But there’s some surprising versatility there! …Although now I say that out loud it sounds kinda murder-y…
Permanents are your friends</p>

<p>The best way I have to describe this build is Black Spellslinger. It wouldn’t be wrong to say you’re trying to cast at least one instant per turn once Toshiro hits the board, and squeezing every last trigger out of the recently deceased. Also an advance warning: the first few times you whip this out you WILL misplay. I’m still doing it. There are so many options at any given time that unless you give it your full attention, you’ll be leaving value on the table. And that’s a really good thing!! Honestly, most of my decks run a little on the janky side so having something more interesting is scratching an itch I didn’t know I had! With that - on to the build!</p>

<p>Funnily enough the core of this deck is also the part that’s most ripe for experimentation. Black is obviously rife with creature removal so your options for which pieces to run are <em>almost</em> endless. Here I’ve decided to highlight just a couple of my favorites. But hey! “Y’all do y’all”, as Julian would say.</p>

<p><strong><a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/c16/13/curtains-call?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/d/dd71fd53-5c84-4d08-a7f5-16657413ac4c.jpg?1562422618' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Curtains’ Call
</a></strong> is from that <em>Commander 2016</em> cycle of cards that has <em>Undaunted</em>, aka they cost less for each opponent you have. I don’t think I’ve ever seen any others played outside of <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/cm2/36/sublime-exhalation?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/3/1/31bc725b-91d8-4f81-b228-d28759e88c00.jpg?1562273343' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Sublime Exhalation
</a> but destroying two target creatures for (usually) 3 mana is a steal. This is also your first reminder that any kill spell that pulls double duty results in TWO triggers for Toshiro, so use that as you will. (Fun rules fact: You can target an instant you just cast to destroy a creature with the resulting Toshiro trigger. So something like <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/96/malicious-affliction?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/1/2/127f3f4d-93f4-4e52-b3c1-325c3981e0e1.jpg?1580014290' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Malicious Affliction
</a> can be cast from your hand to kill one thing, targeted with Toshiro’s ability, and then be cast from the yard to kill two more thanks to <em>Morbid</em>. Food for thought.)</p>

	Deadly Rollick
</a>  - cause it exiles) can be cast for 0 when you need them and boy oh boy, coming across one copy of these can be annoying enough but two?? That’s a potential of six free pieces of targeted removal per game.</p>

	Drag to the Underworld
</a></strong> is nothing special, but due to its recent printing it might not show up as high on usage charts. I’m here on its behalf to remind you that with Toshiro out this will just cost double black and be a very cost efficient removal spell</p>

<p>Outside of instants, might I also suggest the following for your death triggers? Turns out Black’s pretty good at wiping things out at sorcery speed too…</p>

<p>Boardwipes are a critical part of any EDH build, and here they pull double duty. One-sided wraths like <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/c19/121/in-garruks-wake?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/6/d/6dd6ab0e-0c3c-4e91-9d9f-6c0dccc88737.jpg?1568004241' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	In Garruk’s Wake

	Damnation

	Feed the Swarm
</a> is Black’s first foray into targeted enchantment removal which has been one of Black’s weaknesses since the beginning so while it can destroy creatures, it’ll probably be used for the other mode more often than not.</p>

<p>When you’re not raining hellfire, sometimes you need spells that do OTHER things. I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes you’ll want these even more than kill spells.</p>

	Black Market
</a> is an older flavor, but even more potent in the mana generation department once it really gets a fat stack of counters, something we’re happy to assist and provide. Some games I’ve been able to cast my entire hand without touching my landbase.</p>

<p>This is a pretty typical package, but for those of you that don’t know, Black can pull off some absolutely heinous stuff when it comes to mana generation. Mostly it’s due to two key cards and their variants: <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/254/urborg-tomb-of-yawgmoth?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/0/2/02e17705-739e-409f-a6fd-7bab22120b22.jpg?1559959336' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Primal Amulet
</a></strong> is a fun way to trick opponents into thinking you probably can’t cast anything with the one mana you have open and then BAM! <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/91/heartless-act?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/e/4/e4e6794a-feeb-4fc8-a2ee-38c75c18aaae.jpg?1591226819' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Primal Wellspring
</a> right. In a deck with such a high instant count this gets exponential quickly as it doubles our Toshiro triggers as well. I quickly realized why there’s been a greater push for land destruction in EDH.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>And that’s it! A powerful Black commander that can bring the hurt consistently and provide a greater challenge to pilot than what I usually bring to the table. I highly recommend giving Toshiro a look and drawing a few sample hands. You won’t look back…</p>

                                <p>Welcome back y’all to the second installment of <em>Historically Speaking</em>! History isn’t written overnight and I’ve been taking my time to test many decks from the meta and playing against even more. I came out victorious in many battles, but I also did a <strong>lot</strong> of losing (hence the title, and also cause I wanted to continue the <em>Star Wars</em> references). It wasn’t all for naught though. After all that struggle, I think I’ve finally come up with a comprehensive overview of what’s out there as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each deck.</p>

<p>I’ve broken down the decks under broad archetypes and then will discuss specific decks within and close out with more broad conclusions. But with so much to cover, I think it’s best to just jump right in!

<p>There are three notable tribal decks in the format, uncoincidentally, some that have had the longest and most successful histories in <em>Magic</em>: Goblins, Elves, and Merfolk. All three have a plethora of good creatures to choose from as well as a healthy selection of lords and can be held together by one of the pillars of the format, <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/dtk/177/collected-company?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/c/f/cfa7b456-7e83-4587-a875-9b35fde318c2.jpg?1582117536' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

In the early game, Merfolk lack the explosive mana generation of Elves or Goblins to establish a dominating board presence quickly. While they can build up an impressive army and beat out other generic creature deck, any deck that tries to go under then can either push damage quicker or at least take out key pieces before critical mass is achieved.

<p>Lastly, we have Goblins, the best tribal deck, and potentially the only “combo deck” in the meta.

</a> more than makes up for that. Goblins can strike out of nowhere, which makes them a big threat.

	Muxus, Goblin Grandee
</a>. Muxus is what puts this deck over the top and why I call it a combo deck.

</a>’s insane mana generation (plus <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/294/phyrexian-tower?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/e/deb95b6f-db1d-40bd-8eff-62b6362ab744.jpg?1599768153' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Phyrexian Tower
</a> at times). A turn three or four Muxus isn’t out of the question and can even be common. And depending on your luck with the trigger, you can easily end the game right there, or at least mortally wound your opponent giving them a single turn to deal with your army.</p>

<p>As the deck I played the most, and my favorite during testing, I can say that this deck can live or die by variance. A Muxus flip of only one or two goblins can lose you the game and even if you get a veritable army, no haste can leave you vulnerable to <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/43/wrath-of-god?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/b/2/b20cb69c-ff2e-45cf-ab04-cb47bccf9c08.jpg?1599768671' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Wrath of God
</a> which is running rampant in midrange and control decks. Also, with a six mana Muxus that you’re striving to get to, this deck runs a reasonable number of lands, but that can translate into flood if you get to a quick start and then get wrathed or dismantled which can stagnate and catch you an L.

Overall, tribal decks are fun for their explosiveness and the potential to attack with a thick board of pumped up creatures. Also, the ability of all three of these decks (yes I even saw some goblins decks splashing) to play <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/dtk/177/collected-company?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/c/f/cfa7b456-7e83-4587-a875-9b35fde318c2.jpg?1582117536' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Collected Company
</a> is a boon. However, these decks generally lack the interaction to prevent an opponent’s game plan and are very weak to opposing interaction, especially in the early game when attempting to build a board state and a single stumble can crumble your whole plan.</p>

<h2 id="aggro-decks">Aggro Decks</h2>

<p>Aggro decks is a wide label, which arguably includes tribal decks, but I’ve identified a few distinct archetypes that stood out: Rakdos Arcanist, Lurrus Auras, and everyone’s favorite… Burn!</p>

<p>Lurrus Auras is an Azorius Bogles-esque deck.

	Kor Spiritdancer
</a>. A veteran from Modern Bogles, she was introduced with <em>Jumpstart</em> and can get oppressively big while continuing to rip through your deck. Playing your final aura onto a Spiritdancer, drawing another aura, rinse and repeat until you run out of mana, is an easy and common line. This deck also plays <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/226/lurrus-of-the-dream-den?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/5/a/5ad36fb2-c44e-4085-ba0d-54277841ad3a.jpg?1591228429' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Lurrus of the Dream-Den
</a> because why not, so of course it can grind and return any auras for a second run, just when your opponent thought they’d gotten rid of the pesky things.</p>

<p>The weakness of this deck is you can get X-for-one’d if your opponent removes your Megazord, especially if they remove your creature out from under an aura on the stack. <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/1/alseid-of-lifes-bounty?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/3/6/36c8c075-9597-412e-9fc4-9d73b4405d12.jpg?1581478926' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

</a> provide protection at key chokepoints, especially against decks heavy with removal or if you aren’t off to a blistering start (which can be common). The other weakness of this deck is of course going all in on a creature can make it hard to rebuild.

	Ramunap Ruins
</a> is just extra reach for the late game, but it can really allow you to push damage and be a little reckless with your attacks when you know you have four to six damage waiting on the field to close out an opponent. In a similar vein, <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/hou/90/earthshaker-khenra?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/0/d/0d60eabe-b281-4eba-9c26-287364ed2067.jpg?1562789387' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Earthshaker Khenra
</a> also allows this deck to last a lot longer than normal mono-red decks. Khenra pushes damage early with its ETB and then when you’ve flooded out or have been slowly ground to a minimal board state, eternalize that bad boy and smash face out of nowhere. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition and no one expects a 4/4 in a burn.

</a> with its 1/2 body for one mana and prowess. Its pseudo-wither ability is also far from negligible.

Burn’s greatest strength is its ability to get going fast, disrupt anything its opponent might be doing in terms of blocking and then close out with prowess buffs or direct damage. If you’re any kind of creature deck, especially one that focuses on small creatures, burn can run you over easily if you stumble, and sometimes even if you don’t. However, if you’re playing disruption like <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/109/thoughtseize?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Thoughtseize
</a> and lots of removal or thick creatures, you can essentially brick wall burn. Also, any sort of deck that gains incidental or buckets of life can be an issue, as you might expect.</p>

<p>Finally, we have what I would argue is the best deck in the format right now: Rakdos Arcanist. Also lovingly called “Rakdos, You Can’t Have Any Fun” (at least by me), this deck is brutally fast and efficient at making sure you do everything and your opponent doesn’t do anything. If you can’t tell, I lost to this deck way too many times. I have the empty ice cream containers to prove it.

<h2 id="the-story-so-far">The Story So Far…</h2>

<p>The name of the game in Historic is to go fast and be disruptive. If you’re a slow deck or if you have no way to disrupt your opponents gameplan, you aren’t going to succeed. Decks like Merfolk and Elves don’t hold a candle to Rakdos Arcanist which can not only go faster, but can stop them at every step of the game. Azorius Auras can thrive because it can protect its threat against this disruption or get big enough to shake off burn spells.</p>

<p>Another key is not trading resources at an even rate with your opponent. Eternalizing an <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/hou/90/earthshaker-khenra?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/0/d/0d60eabe-b281-4eba-9c26-287364ed2067.jpg?1562789387' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

Lastly, prioritize your best cards and what you need to get your gameplan moving. Each deck has a few key cards that are much more important than the rest, proactively and reactively. I think my biggest mistake while testing was not taking enough mulligans. The biggest example of this is in Goblins where cards like <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/dom/144/skirk-prospector?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/1/6/1636d138-aa63-476f-a930-41b1be988032.jpg?1562731846' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Muxus, Goblin Grandee
</a>, which should be your Plan A, every single game. A mull to five with one of each of those is probably better than a full grip of seven with four average to good goblins.</p>

                                <p>Welcome back to another article in <em>The Top Shelf</em> series, where we look at a casual build and cEDH build for one commander. After a raucous romp with Syr Carah a while ago, I think it’s time to chill out a bit. I’ve come prepared this week, I’ve done my research, and I’ve even planned both decks before starting the article! <em>Cue applause</em>. Thank you, thank you… but in all seriousness, let’s get right into it. This week we’ll be staying on <em>Eldraine</em> and looking to

<p>Chulane was designed to support the soft reboot of the Brawl format and he certainly has the power to do so. His triggered ability helps you keep your hand full and your mana base growing, while his activated ability can help protect important creatures or repeat powerful enter the battlefield (ETB) effects. When looking at the casual list I realized I was putting a lot of creatures into the deck to maximize these ETBs. This made me curious… Do I have enough creatures and other permanents to build a

</a> deck? The answer is I can certainly try! Meanwhile, for the competitive deck I was able to find an incredible primer for the iCameo (an abbreviation of the deck’s wincons) build written by the user Joking101 that helped inspire this article.  iCameo is an adaptive combo build that uses Chulane’s triggered ability to nearly deck itself then win through combat damage.</p>

<p>This deck will run you right around $250. I think this deck is actually a great example of how I want my casual decks to play. They should have a solid game plan, multiple win conditions, and should feel cool to pilot. During testing for this, I felt like I nailed all those aspects. I think I was aided in no small part by the star of the show:

</a>. This card is not just powerful and cool, and to use it to its full advantage we have to succumb to one of the most stringent deck building restrictions this side of Companion: don’t include any other instants or sorceries in your deck. “Why would I ever do that Eric?” Well, I’ll tell you. This will allow us to dump every other card left in our deck straight into play. Then, we immediately go for the win with cards like <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/7/2/726e8b29-13e9-4138-b6a9-d2a0d8188d1c.jpg?1582752984' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

<p>We don’t always want to be quite so reactive though. Sometimes it’s much better to go and blow up people’s stuff before they start causing us problems.

	Terastodon
</a> can also help clean up noncreature permanents, but that still leaves us lacking in terms of ways to kill our opponent’s threatening or high value creatures.

	Calix, Destiny’s Hand
</a> can let us exile even more creatures under our enchantments. Repeatable removal tied to this ability is important for us given how limited removal can be without instants and sorceries.Some cards in a similar vein to this, but much better for targeting commanders are <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/cma/147/song-of-the-dryads" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/0/c/0ccb4579-b090-45f6-a967-cec2c195f565.jpg?1592673193' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Primal Surge
</a> doesn’t just limit our removal and control tools. Value generation and ramp often come from instants and sorceries, so we still need to find some cheeky workarounds in that category. The deck is full of low cost creatures, so we should be able to cycle through those pretty quickly given that each of them is a cantrip when Chulane is in play. <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/c20/167/beast-whisperer?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/0/a/0aa99539-0002-4661-85b2-a3d770ff004c.jpg?1591320775' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Beast Whisperer
</a> lets us double up on drawing whenever we cast a creature and with cards like <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/c17/145/abundance?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/7/f/7f3fff7e-f34d-4a99-a805-bd66c4e9f0cb.jpg?1562614406' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Abundance
</a> we can also maximize the value of each draw. <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/aer/105/aid-from-the-cowl?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/5/6/565cb7fc-cf90-4020-84fe-05ec7b18709d.jpg?1576381957' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Aid from the Cowl
</a> is another great enchantment for value maximization. As long as you’re using Chulane’s bounce ability, your deck is all permanents so it’s either a permanent into play or free ramp every turn.</p>

	Coiling Oracle
</a> is a great card for us whether it’s acting as draw or ramp. But there are more consistent cards for ramping I’d like to look at. <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/cma/170/wood-elves?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/7/7/77f95da2-cbc4-4430-adb7-75f4c469d98e.jpg?1592673328' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Wood Elves
</a> is an obvious one, it allows us to fetch forests, so we can even grab a few of the dual lands we managed to sneak into the budget. In a deck like this <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/181/springbloom-druid?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/6/1/6161d2ed-7cff-4c90-9e74-1d179a6c1498.jpg?1562202198' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Harrow
</a> on a stick and can put in some solid work for us with a few bounces. <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/pz2/70785/avatar-of-growth?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/2/3/2371143a-2c73-48d0-9ff2-95ff3d8888da.jpg?1545872872' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

<h2 id="once-upon-a-time-mulligan">Once Upon a Time (Mulligan)</h2>
<p>Let’s make sure you get your tale off to a proper start with a good first hand. For our game plan if you have a hand that is even marginally keepable with 
<a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/avr/189/primal-surge?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/4/2/4278f7bd-afff-4a1d-a0bb-bf9ce3ad5a2e.jpg?1592709414' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Primal Surge
</a>, you should keep it. In most hands you’ll want to have a few lands and a few other pieces of ramp. We’ll be able to hit the gas pretty well once we get Chulane out onto the field, so keeping a hand full of pretty small creatures or mana dorks isn’t actually that hurtful. Chulane is a prime target for removal, so we should prioritize any hand that includes either protection or a secondary engine we can use to bait removal or keep things going if Chulane doesn’t work out. Removal is always nice to have, but we definitely want to get off the ground and get the ball rolling as quickly as we can. Drawing into interaction later can be better than sitting on it early, but that also depends on the speed of other decks at your table. In a more aggressive pod it can be worth it to keep a few pieces of interaction and wait to play Chulane until you can really get the engines going. The full decklist for this build can be found below.</p>

	Chulane, Teller of Tales

</a> are two great cards for a deck like ours, which is happy to spend resources to slow down the game and relies very little on artifacts. Any of your favorite hate bear style cards can easily slot into this deck if you find that these aren’t working well in your meta. What matters is that when you need to, you can slow other players down and bring the game to your tempo.</p>

<p>Pumping the breaks and going slow is cool and all, but have you tried going really fast? It’s also pretty sick. With a five mana commander we can’t get too trigger happy and need to be very careful about when we play him, but in the right pod we can definitely fall into the most aggressive position drawing into one of our combos very early with the right start. We have the ramp to get our mana in place very quickly with the number of dorks we’re running. Once that is all setup, we can quickly find our winning cards with tutors like

<p>Please take a seat for this next part, I have some unfortunate news for you all… the other players at the table are trying to kill us. I know, I know, it’s terrible. Take all the time you need to process. Due to the fact that we aren’t just trying to turbo out a win con, we are probably going to need to stop them from killing us before we can actually win. So, we’ll be running some ways to protect ourselves just in case.

	Chulane, Teller of Tales
</a> with a wrap on how to best start a game. Given that this deck has a high density of combos, tutors, and draw we can actually afford to be just a bit less choosy with our opening hands. We really need to start the game with a strong ramp opener though. That part of our game plan is pretty immovable. From there your mulligan diverges based on the other decks at the table. Often you might look around and feel like you’re playing one of the slower decks at the table. In that case, you should prioritize keeping control and stax pieces. You still need enough draw to get your own game plan into action down the line, but stopping others from snatching the game right away can often be key. I am fortunate enough to have some friends who believe that a fourway stax mirror is peak Magic, so we can also end up in the most “aggressive” position at the table in some scenarios. In those situations we should focus more on some of the protective cards I highlighted earlier. If we have the gas to win, we need to make sure those pesky control players and other player’s stax pieces don’t get in our way. The full deck list is linked below. I’ve included some other ways to win the game in the side board and have a full write up of each win condition in the primer. I’ll see you next time!</p>

After multiple big shake-ups in Standard, I can sort of play base Simic decks with a reasonable conscience. So today I reunited with one of my favorite decks from the beginning of this year: Temur Adventures!</p>

<p>After the disappointing performance of Naya Adventures last time, this deck really brings the heat. Once again, I cast <a class="accented-link external-card-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/115/bonecrusher-giant-stomp?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/0/9/09fd2d9c-1793-4beb-a3fb-7a869f660cd4.jpg?1572490299' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

After a week and a half spent driving across the country and getting acclimated to the constant sunshine and mellow temperatures of Southern California, I can once again spend countless hours inside with the blinds closed playing Arena. We’re back…</p>

<p>…and with quite the spicy brew! This deck actually took me quite some time to tweak and get juuust right, but I have a feeling you’ll love the end product. For this fine installment of <em>Enter the Guildhall</em> we’ll be following <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/224/radha-heart-of-keld?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/2/b/2bbd37b1-49cb-4295-9a1f-fb85368a8f12.jpg?1594737431' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

This iteration of Radha is a departure from her “mana dork” roots, but what an explosive pump ability! And it can be repeated!! Ooooookay, huddle in and let’s talk strategy.</p>

It shouldn’t be a surprise that this deck is going to be base-green. Considering the only thing kinda Red about Radha’s design is first strike (although I guess you could make an argument for massive pump being Gruul given things like <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/bng/156/xenagos-god-of-revels?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/3/1/3184b138-1109-4195-9d96-4f190164e98b.jpg?1593092838' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Xenagos, God of Revels
</a>), the bulk of Radha’s ability suite will come from playing lands of all shapes and sizes; very Green indeed.</p>

<p>Once we have a decent manabase online it’ll be time to swing in with Radha and a collection of Gruul allstars. Since we’re in Green we’ll include <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/171/questing-beast?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/4/e41cf82d-3213-47ce-a015-6e51a8b07e4f.jpg?1572490640' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

</a>, etc. but Red won’t be outdone. Now, I don’t want to give too much away in the intro but <em>ahem</em> BOY I sure am TERRIFIED of these PEAKS. More on that below.</p>

<p>After that comes some super secret Gruul sauce I’ve wanted to try out and a dash of removal to spice it up.  Presto! One haymaker fresh out of the oven.</p>

</a></strong> is our best chance to get a multi-activation Radha going and while I never was able to put the two together I honestly might just keep playing this deck until I do. With a chance to be <em>tripling</em> the land benefit as well as all the other ridiculous stuff Green can do with three times the mana Nyxbloom’s troops will leave no opponent standing.</p>

	Terror of the Peaks
</a></strong> is proof that there’s actually red in this deck. Terror is a uhh “Terror” on its own, but given Green’s propensity to be playing big creatures it’s a match made in heaven to systematically wipe your opponent’s board. And their face.</p>

<h2 id="gimme-that-good-gruul">Gimme That Good Gruul</h2>

<p>If you’ve been into Brawl since it’s return in <em>Eldraine</em> you know just how ridiculously strong Green is. I can say quite honestly it’s second to none and any decks I’ve schemed up with Green in them generally rely on it to do the heavy lifting. That being said, it would be wrong to completely ignore Radha’s Red tilt. We saw Terror of the Peaks above but there are some powerful pieces that make the perfect complement to Green’s rampant board domination.</p>

</a></strong> might be out of Standard’s good graces, but in a deck where lands are the name of the game? The synergies are priceless.

Does it still feel good to drop a <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/167/cavalier-of-thorns?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/4/e4662a9c-3cbd-41f7-8c15-d048a3826a42.jpg?1592517175' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Rhythm of the Wild
</a></strong> is one of Gruul’s best support pieces against the ridiculous number of people in Brawl’s queue who have the audacity to counter my spells. In the playtests I did to prepare for this article, three of the five games I played with this particular build were up against decks that played at LEAST seven counterspells each. I’m not about that, and Rhythm saved my butt many a time making sure we could play our big ugly monsters (and get Radha on the board which is usually quite difficult)</p>

<p>…is all I have to say about that.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>

<p>So…I’m not lying when I say this deck has had the best record I’ve ever recorded with an <em>Enter The Guildhall</em> deck. When I finally put this list together after countless versions and tweaks I went 5-0, but I will concede two of those victories were due in part to opponent misplays. In one against <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/220/tamiyo-collector-of-tales?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/7/6/76776b24-a2e1-4590-88e7-8a421baf2fc4.jpg?1557577288' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

	Rhythm of the Wild
</a> was on the field which… didn’t go how they were expecting.</p>

<p>In another close game against <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/76/thryx-the-sudden-storm?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/4/2/4238b089-c6d8-4e4b-b6a1-a0f89e3b4968.jpg?1581479609' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Thryx, the Sudden Storm
</a> I swung for lethal with a Radha that had mutated with <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/165/migratory-greathorn?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/6/a/6a2a287b-b83f-444f-84f7-e388beb616c2.jpg?1591227787' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

</a> on top meaning my Radha was now a four cmc 3/4 with all the rest of her abilities. This became quite important when my opponent activated their <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/244/blast-zone?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/a/ea6bc7d5-e8f6-4103-920c-9f7ec5cd6c28.jpg?1557577452' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Blast Zone
</a> for three (Radha’s cmc) and was left wondering why it hadn’t worked.</p>

<p>In short, always read your opponents cards - even if you think you know what they do. They still could surprise you.</p>

<p>That’s not to say this isn’t a super strong deck, it is! Hitting someone for 21 is satisfying to such a core level my inner caveman was jumping up and down beating his chest. This deck does what Gruul does best. Smash.</p>

                                <p>What’s good y’all?! Today, Hexdrinkers treads into new territory… <em>Historic</em>! I’ve been hearing increasing murmurs of the format and its potential greatness. With my interest in <em>Standard</em> waning for the time being, and the recent shakeups across many formats, I figured this was a perfect time for me to fully delve into the format in a new series: <em>Historically Speaking…</em>!

But as I was booting MTGA up, I realized, I have no clue what I’m doing.</p>

<p>So, for my benefit and your entertainment, this article will detail the beginning of my foray into <em>Historic</em>; how it works, the card pool, the in and outs, I’ll present my full research on all of this as a baseline for moving forward. I’ll also discuss the meta a bit, though that is in flux at the moment. This article will mostly act as a sort of primer and then I hope to get into gameplay and deck techs later on.</p>

<em>Historic</em> is a non-rotating format exclusive to <em>MTG Arena</em>. This means that unlike <em>Standard</em> cards will stay in the format forever unless they’re banned. The <em>Historic</em> pool includes any cards that have ever made their way to <em>Arena</em>. <em>Dominaria</em>, <em>Ixalan</em> as well as the more recent pick-and-choose remasters but we’ll get to those in a minute.</p>

<p>Since <em>Historic</em> was designed as a digital format, it also allows <em>Wizards</em> to tweak it and try new things on a much larger scale and more consistently. This is a uniqueness that you can’t get in paper formats or ones that have long standing histories. Now you may be thinking that just means bannings and unbannings will be much more frequent, but there are other ways to shake up the format that are more interesting and arguably healthier than constant banlist adjustment.</p>

<h2 id="old-toys--new-toys">Old Toys = New Toys</h2>

<p>Historic, similar to the precedent set by <em>Modern Masters</em> last year, has its own unique sets that inject cards directly into the format bypassing <em>Standard</em> completely. These <em>Historic Anthologies</em> are small, curated batches of cards from across <em>Magic’s</em> vast history designed to fill gaps in the format. Adding answers to unchecked strategies, fan favorites from history, or support for new archetypes that need a boost, that’s what these products do for the format.. Powerhouses from days gone by like

	Thalia, Guardian of Thraben

	Serra Ascendant
</a>. These anthologies cover a broad spectrum of interesting play styles and eras to make <em>Historic</em> truly unique.</p>

<p>So far, three of these anthologies have been released. <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/ha1?as=grid&amp;order=set" target="_blank"><em>Historic Anthology I</em></a> in November of 2019 brought 20 new cards, <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/ha2?as=grid&amp;order=set" target="_blank"><em>Historic Anthology II</em></a> in March of 2020 had an increased 25 cards, and in May of 2020, <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/ha3?as=grid&amp;order=set" target="_blank"><em>Historic Anthology 3</em></a> upped the package again to 27 new cards to play with. Each one (which granted a playset of each card included) was available for 3400 gems on <em>Arena</em>, or individual cards could be crafted using the wildcard system. Though these are no longer available as bundles like before, <em>Wizards</em> has said they hope to drop new cards into <em>Historic</em> every quarter, so we can almost certainly expect anthologies 4, 5, etc. to drop moving into next year with a similar amount of cards (or slightly increased) and with a similar “price point”.

Though that isn’t the only way new cards get added into <em>Historic</em>. In December of 2019, 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/213/rhys-the-redeemed?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/b/9/b91dadcb-31e9-43b0-b425-c9311af3e9d7.jpg?1596139016' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Rhys, the Redeemed
</a> was added into both <em>Brawl</em> and <em>Historic</em> as part of the <em>Brawlidays</em> special event. Though nothing like this has happened since, it’s safe to say that we could receive singular (or much smaller than an anthology) drops as part of special events at really any time.</p>

<p>The most recent and largest addition to the format comes in the form of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/introducing-jumpstart-new-way-play-magic-2020-02-20" target="_blank"><em>Jumpstart</em></a>, the supplemental summer set released a few weeks back. <em>Jumpstart</em> included a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/jumpstart" target="_blank">host of tasty reprints as well as a slew of new cards</a> to assist each theme (and cater to eternal formats). Because of this and with its release on <em>Arena</em>, <em>Jumpstart</em> cards also were added into <em>Historic</em> (with a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/jumpstart-cards-being-replaced-mtg-arena-2020-06-17" target="_blank">caveat</a>). Exciting!</p>

<h2 id="time-out">Time-Out</h2>

<p>So we have dedicated, curated drops, special event inclusions, as well as supplemental sets that can get added. All of these avenues mean the <em>Historic</em> card pool is continually growing and cards that are new and exciting as well as helpful to the meta are constantly being shuffled in. But sometimes action needs to be taken to help balance the format.

<p><br />
I’m of course talking about the traditional way of “fixing” formats… <strong>Bannings</strong>. Something that we’ve been all too familiar with over the past year. <a href="https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Historic_(format)" target="_blank"><em>Historic</em> has a banned list</a> just like other formats (in fact, it looks quite similar to <em>Standard’s</em>, more on that later), but it also has a second form of disciplinary action: the Suspension.</p>

<p>Another benefit of an all digital format is that instead of having to go through the ordeal of outright banning something, <em>Wizards</em> can suspend cards, essentially putting them in “time-out”. A suspended card is not legal in the format, but it only remains in that status for a short time (usually one to two months). During this time, the meta can readjust and <em>Wizards</em> can watch to see if the format becomes healthier or if other problems arise. After the allotted time, the card either moves from suspension to banning, or can be reintroduced into the card pool. Most cards so far have gotten banned after serving their time, but some cards have been returned to the format and it sets a nice precedent for the future.</p>

<p>Being able to more quickly take action, test the effects of certain changes, and also not having the feel-bads or negative PR of a true ban, the suspension system is interesting and probably good for <em>Historic</em> and one of the benefits of an all digital format.</p>

<h2 id="as-above-so-below">As Above, So Below</h2>

<p>Lastly, let’s discuss the <em>Historic</em> meta briefly, so we know what we’re getting ourselves into. Given the power of the last year and a half of printings and also the so far limited card pool of the format, a lot of it looks similar to recent <em>Standard</em>. Up until the suspensions, Temur Reclamation was the top deck with variation on Bant and Sultai Ramp also doing well and variations of Sacrifice and Mono-red jockeying for position. In previous iterations of the format,

After digesting several metagame breakdowns and deck techs, I feel I have a reasonable understanding of the <em>Historic</em> metagame. One of the characteristics setting it apart from <em>Standard</em> is the presence of several powerful aggressive decks (though the recent bannings have started to prompt a resurgence in <em>Standard</em>). Mono-red, similar to its <em>Standard</em> counterpart, is strong and recently a top-tier version of a Goblins deck has emerged thanks to the additions in <em>Jumpstart</em> and

</a>, I suspect that these tier two decks will quickly rise to fill the space. Also, <em>Jumpstart</em> cards are still fresh and haven’t been tested fully, so I hope they will start to make even more impacts and soon we’ll have a new set in <em>Zendikar Rising</em> to shake things up even more!</p>

<p>I’m excited to explore this fresh new format! Next week I’ll be doing a deeper dive into the current decks and testing some of them out. After that it’s off to the Hexdrinkers special laboratory to concoct up some lists of our own! Hit us up in the comments or on social media for anything you want to see me build around, and remember to stay brewin’ y’all!!

                                <p>Athreos is back and better than ever in the recently-released Theros, Beyond Death. As a commander, he represents a resilient threat that’s able to provide ungodly amounts of value over the course of a long game. In this edition of Plus 40, we’re going to take a look at what kinds of cards compliment him and his powerful end-of-turn triggered ability in a Brawl and EDH setting.</p>

<h2 id="on-removal">On Removal</h2>
<p>Removal in all forms is such a pivotal and emblematic part of running a deck helmed by
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/269/athreos-shroud-veiled?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/8/7/871c19fc-7d99-4022-9e13-d679a9e3547e.jpg?1581901443' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Athreos, Shroud-Veiled
</a>. Lucky for us, his color identity comprises perhaps the two colors best known in Magic for their effectiveness in creature removal, black and white.</p>

<p>Ideally, we want removal that only kills a single creature to be instant speed. Nothing groundbreaking here but instant speed removal serves the auxiliary purpose of giving us an extra target every turn cycle that’s been marked by a coin counter. This helps us set up for much larger turnarounds using our opponent’s creatures against them.</p>

<p>One of the best ways I’ve found to utilize this is to kill an opponent’s creature after they’ve declared attackers but before blockers are declared. Then, once that creature returns under your control, use it to ambush block another creature attacking you. Another form of spot removal I’d like to discuss here isn’t instant speed but provides other forms of synergy with Athreos, and that would be “O-ring” type effects:</p>

<p>As we’ve discussed here<link to="" reference="" /> before, targeting someone’s commander in Brawl or EDH with one of these cards generally results in the commander being sent back to the command zone. Along these same lines, when a creature with a coin counter is hit by an O-ring spell, rather than being temporarily trapped by the enchantment the creatures are exiled and instantly return to your side. I had considered various “flicker” spells for similar reasons, but found them to be too useless when Athreos wasn’t on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Moving on to larger forms of removal, boardwipes are some of the most value-centric spells in the game. With Athreos’ coin counters this power is turned up to eleven, giving a single wrath effect the power to twist an unfavorable board state into a crushing victory:</p>

</a>. I’m not exaggerating when I say that cards like these are so powerful in this deck that we want to run at least four if possible.

<h2 id="the-landbase">The Landbase</h2>
<p>The most striking thing about this iteration of Athreos is perhaps his mana cost, which is now double that of his previous form. Hitting land drops for the first five to six turns is imperative in this deck, as our curve is going to be steep and a turn without playing a land could spell doom to an aggressive or midrange deck. Though it may seem excessive, I would recommend running 26-27 lands to diminish the chances of missing a land drop until after we’ve resolved Athreos at least once.</p>

<p>Thankfully, our mana base is relatively simple in this two-color deck. The auto-includes should be obvious- anything in Standard that can tap for both black and white is fair game, including of course:</p>

<p>We’ll be running a few “color-hungry” cards in this deck as well, so fetch lands like Fabled Passage and Evolving wilds are welcome. I’d argue that even Scoured Barrens and Orzhov Guildgate deserve a spot. The important thing is that we’re hitting a land every turn early on, not necessarily that every land we’re playing is coming in untapped. And while

<h2 id="mana-accelerants">Mana Accelerants</h2>
<p>We want to get our big spells out early in Brawl or some decks will be able to run us over before we can get the ball rolling. For this reason, ramp spells in the 2-4 mana range will be our target:</p>

<p>The theme here is ramp spells that do things for us besides just add mana. This deck values a long game with its ability to recur creatures and spells that trade one-for-many.

	Solemn Simulacrum
</a>, already a format staple, ticks off every bonus box for us being a four mana creature that gets us to six mana the following turn in addition to having an ETB and a dies trigger, all qualities Atheros can take advantage of.

	Orzhov locket
</a> is a nice mana sink during long games thanks to our high land count and we need all the card draw we can get given the limited options we have to work with.

	Altar of the Pantheon
</a> is an enigma, at a glance it may seem like a perfect fit for the deck, but after playtesting I found that more often than not it was actually slightly less useful to have enough devotion for Athreos to be a creature. Despite being a great blocker, he becomes vulnerable to much more common forms of removal as a creature. This is not to say that having the extra devotion is a downside necessarily, but I wouldn’t consider it a plus either. Still, Altar only adds a single devotion and the lifegain afforded by it isn’t negligible against aggressive decks so it’s probably still worth the inclusion. Overall it would be more detrimental than anything for us to try and limit ourselves to using permanents with less mana symbols just to try and keep Athreos as an enchantment-only.</p>

<h2 id="creatures-and-finishers">Creatures and Finishers</h2>
<p>Creatures with strong ETB and/or dies triggers are going to be quintessential to our success with this deck. Mentioned before, Solemn Simulacrum is a paragon example of what we want to maximize the value of Athreos’ ability when our opponents are running few or low-value creatures.</p>

<p>In general we’ll want to keep most of our creatures in the higher CMC range to maximize the value of the coin counters we end up putting on our own creatures. Being able to resolve a boardwipe before any of your creatures even hit the battlefield for the first time is also a great way to roll out the red carpet for them. The on-color Cavaliers both provide fantastic value when recurred multiple times, and Massacre Wurm/Girl are both creatures that will at least partially wipe the board every time they enter the battlefield, which is almost always good for this deck.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that you should discount creatures that aren’t as synergous as the above. There are plenty of creatures that are good enough on their own merits to be worth an include:</p>

<p>This article was constructed deliberately to leave some slots in the deck up to the reader. Listed above are some of my favorites that I found when experimenting with the deck. The main similarities between them is that they’re all hefty, evasive creatures that can help us close out a game quickly once they’re in play.</p>

<p>It truly is a shame how poorly Athreos and his pup synergize with each other. The flavor of Kunoros is great and all but he really doesn’t belong beside his master for the purposes of this deck. Having creatures unable to be recurred by Athreos because Kunoros won’t let them back out of the graveyard after they’ve died is not going to help us win any games.

	Heartless Act
</a> ticks many of the boxes that define a good removal spell but is unable to outright kill any creature with a coin counter on it, making it a terrible choice for this deck specifically. Lastly,
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/87/cling-to-dust?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/5/2/52c2de5f-e486-4cfe-9fb6-be0078ce5f93.jpg?1581479717' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Cling to Dust
</a> is a superb graveyard hate card but an undeniable part of its draw is its escape ability which we’ll be unlikely to ever activate due to how few cards will accumulate in our graveyard over the course of the game. If things are going well for us hardly any cards will be in our graveyard at all and if they are then Cling or any other escape card in black and white for that matter isn’t going to be the pivot that we need.</p>

<h2 id="eternal-upgrades">Eternal Upgrades</h2>
<p>Athreos shows the potential to shine in Brawl, but what about EDH? Can his powerful synergies keep up with multiple opponents with more life each?</p>

<p>Travelling back through older sets reveals to us plenty of cards that would go well with Athreos:</p>

<p>Efficient removal is something we don’t see as much in modern Magic as the focus of card creation has shifted from “answers” to “threats” over the years. We want to take advantage of the good answers printed in old sets, the prime examples of which are

	Path to Exile
</a>. One thing the black and white colors seem to lack in the current Standard is good unconditional card draw, but luckily we can supplement this weakness with cards like

	Smothering Tithe
</a> embodies exactly this type of oppressive card, it will be an auto-include in many of our opponents’ white EDH decks due to its extremely high ramp value when pitted against multiple foes. Definitely play a copy of your own if you’re able to get your hands on one.</p>

<p>The rest of the page appears to be completely blank… So, I guess I’ll go find her to see if she has anything to share about how to build her decks. Mono red would certainly be a challenge… Her ability to exile cards whenever a player is damaged definitely makes more offensive strategies pay off. Generally the combat step is where your damage is done, especially in less competitive pods. For the first build, I would probably go with something like a budget voltron deck. Using Syr Carah’s ability to exile cards as pseudo draw whenever you land an attack, then pairing red’s love of artifacts with powerful equipment could have something going. In a more competitive vein we don’t want to rely on being able to get attacks off. In reality it would be much better to never even need to tap her, given her lack of haste. That has me leaning toward a storm deck, where we can use burn spells to exile a lot of cards at once. A lot of rituals could keep things moving in terms of mana, then you just burn out your opponents with some of the artifact storm cards. Alright, I guess we should start by heading off to see the lady of the hour!</p>

<h2 id="the-armory">The Armory</h2>
<p>As always I think we’ll be starting with the budget version of the deck. This will run you under $250 and be a great jumping off point for any future voltron decks you want to build. I thought the easiest place to start would be with the damage machine herself,

	Syr Carah, the Bold
</a>, so I got pointed to Carah’s room in the castle. I figured I would find her there, and be done with this article in a hot minute. Turns out, she left. But I did find some cool stuff here that seems to indicate I was on the right track. Her room appears to effectively be just an armory. There’s an

	Assault Suit
</a> sitting in the corner. Passing your commander around the table like this can help stack on commander damage and may even discourage others from killing her. Who doesn’t want a turn to swing the big stick?

</a> is just kinda sitting under her pillow. I can’t imagine it being very comfortable, but I am happy to swerve all the equip costs given that we don’t have a ton of ramp in mono red. Also, there’s a

	Sword of Feast and Famine
</a>! This woman realizes we’re on a budget here right? This thing is an absolute power house, but definitely can’t just get tossed around. This card can give you an instant win, so hold out on playing it if you can, but if you find the right way to use it, slam it and take the W.</p>

</a> in here earlier too. It dropped off three sol rings and a bunch of artifact ramp we can borrow for a turn. This will help us equip all this and play it out in a timely fashion. Anyway, let’s go back out and look for Syr Carah.</p>

<h2 id="another-one">Another One</h2>
<p>Well, her room turned out to be a bust. Let’s head out to the training grounds to take a look for her. I do see a lot of Embereth knights here, but not her.

<h2 id="a-personal-punch">A Personal Punch</h2>

	Price of Progress
</a> falls into a similar vein, but can actually deal some serious damage to greedier players. Thankfully it will barely hurt us, if at all, given that we are a mono colored deck. However, we are hoping for most of our activations to come from attacking. In order to clear the way for these attacks, we can make use of cards like

<h2 id="retracing-our-steps">Retracing Our Steps</h2>
<p>Looking back through everything we’ve learned thus far, we aren’t any closer to actually finding Syr Carah, but we did pretty much reconstruct the first deck for her. The voltron shell is looking strong, so let’s run through your ideal opener then move on to our second deck. In this deck you are going to want to start with 3-5 mana sources in hand. At least two (probably three) of them should be lands. Given how much we are banking on Syr Carah for card advantage, it is going to be important to get her out ASAP. Once she is on the field we’re hoping to land some protection or powerful equipment on her right away. So keeping 1-2 pieces of equipment in your opener can be a great start. We would ideally like to round out our hand with one of our substitute beaters or a burn spell for once Syr Carah is on the field, but this last spot is pretty flexible and might change if you know you’re up against control or aggro mainly. Against aggro we would prefer some removal for their ramp or a way to turn their creatures against them. Against control we should be mulling reasonably hard for a way to ensure Carah can stay on the field for a bit once we play her (e.g.

<p>This version of the deck is about as high powered as I could get it. On commander tier lists I have seen this commander listed in the same tier as

	Atla Palani, Nest Tender
</a>, our first <em>Top Shelf</em> subject. I feel like she may fall just slightly short, but don’t tell her I said anything. Not that anyone could find her right now to tell her. At this point we’ve searched her quarters, the training ground, and I’m running out of ideas. The last part of the castle left is the basement, so let’s take a look and see if I was right about building it as a storm deck for our more competitive option. Well, at a first glance I’m seeing an

<p>Well, there are plenty of classic storm cards that we can include here, even without the use of blue or other traditional storm colors.

	Grapeshot
</a> is an actual storm card that has huge synergy with Syr Carah. Each of the individual copies will trigger her ability, exiling another card and allowing us to see more of our deck at once.

	Past in Flames
</a> will allow us to recur some of our more potent damage spells as well as the rituals we can use to fuel them. These should be saved for some massive turns where you think you might be able to kill a player or even wipe the table.

	Bonus Round
</a> is another card that should be saved for your all-in turns. However, it can be even more of a gamble as you’re often relying on lucky top decks or Carah exiles to keep you going after you start. This is the main weakness of the deck: sometimes you’re forced to go all-in because your opponents will win given another turn cycle.</p>

	Desperate Ritual
</a> is freaking me out, I mean just look at his face. It’s a great card for our deck though, so I guess he can stay. Casting this from our hand to ramp out our commander or just ripping it off the top to keep our storm count climbing is going to be worth looking at his mug though.

	Seething Song
</a> is just a grown up version of the ritual, giving us enough mana to cast Syr Carah by itself. There are also a few less traditional rituals we can run too, including

	Neheb, the Eternal
</a> can be the biggest ritual of all if we are able to land him before passing through combat. The damage we deal in the first half of our turn can all get refunded for hopefully an even bigger second half of the turn.</p>

<p>These ritual effects will be great for keeping us going, but we can make that mana stretch a lot further if we reduce the cost of our spells. I’m sure I saw some cool looking artifacts sitting around down here. 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/cm2/212/ruby-medallion?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/a/d/ad5b8a3c-8c75-4af4-975b-031e39d69da3.jpg?1562275513' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Ruby Medallion
</a> jumps to mind as an easy include. As a mono-red deck we’ll get a lot of mileage out of that one mana reduction. 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/fut/160/cloud-key?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/b/8/b893ab56-44a6-4b3c-bb3e-6deec298cbce.jpg?1562932147' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Cloud Key
</a> asks us to be a bit more picky about what we are reducing, but it shouldn’t be too hard of a choice. Given how key our commander is, creature is a totally viable choice, but once she’s down I would pretty much always pick instant or sorcery depending on what was in my hand.

	Helm of Awakening
</a> sits at the other end of the spectrum. We’ll reduce the cost on pretty much every card in our deck, but we’ll be doing the same for our opponents. We just have to hope we can capitalize off it better than they can, or that they’re dead by the time our turn is over.</p>

<p>We don’t want to cast these spells just once though; two spells (like heads) are better than one.

	Increasing Vengeance
</a>, then copying Vengeance we get two copies of Vengeance and two burn spells. We then recopy vengeance and recopy the burn spell and repeat until everyone is dead. Every card in this combo is useful outside of it, which makes it very easy to run.</p>

<p>Alright, well Syr Carah wasn’t down in the basement either. I’ll finish this up with a mulligan guide then I really gotta figure out what happened last week. This deck, much like our previous one, is all about mana generation. We want to see Syr Carah levels of mana in our opener ideally, but at least 3 repeatable sources of mana could be good enough to hold. Do not, for example, keep an opening with

The perfect hand would also have an artifact tutor or one of our big artifact payoffs for the storm. Well, here’s the deck list. As always I’ve tossed a few of the possible sideboard options in if you want to tech for your meta.

Cauldron Familiar
</a> is banned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wilderness Reclamation has been essentially the defacto best deck in <em>Standard</em> since the last B&amp;R. Reaching above half of the field in tournaments and having been a dominant archetype since it was printed, its time has finally run out.</p>

<p>Growth Spiral lies in a similar vein as ramp decks that run this (normally as a four-of) make uo nearly 70% of the metagame in recent tournaments. Ramp has become synonymous with <em>Standard</em> as of late and Growth Spiral is one of the biggest enablers. Axed.</p>

<p>With Temur Reclamation as a deck now removed from the format, the other two dominant forces naturally will rise up. Rakdos (and to a lesser extent, Jund) sacrifice decks, which in all variations run some combination of cat/oven are quite resilient and lethal. Removing their go-to interaction is a good way to keep them from becoming dominant.</p>

<p>Lastly, Teferi, Time Raveler has been a cause of restriction and frustration since its printing. It’s play patterns are repetitive and completely deny a lot of other strategies or cards from being played. It was the main force holding back Temur Rec from total domination, but with that now gone, there’s no reason for Teferi to stay in the format.</p>

<p>Overall, I wish action had been taken sooner, but these are all good choices that strike at the heart of the issue as opposed to tip-toeing around it. I am sad that Cauldron Familiar is gone as I adore Jund Food (and Chev likes Rakdos Sac, that sadist), but they would have been too dominant with the other pillars removed and cat/oven is an annoying (and on <em>Arena</em>, time consuming) synergy.</p>

<p><strong>Historic:</strong></p>

Wilderness Reclamation
</a> is suspended.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Historic</em> has recently been mirroring <em>Standard</em>. For similar reasons as above, Teferi and Reclamation are getting put in time-out like 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/43/agent-of-treachery?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/c/cc6686e6-4535-49be-b0b3-e76464656cd2.jpg?1592516257' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Agent of Treachery
</a>,

	Fires of Invention
</a>, etc. before them. Like above, I like this action, especially with no rotation in <em>Historic</em> to remove these cards from the format in another two months. I’m still confused with the purpose and effectiveness of the suspension list, but I would not be surprised if Teferi and Reclamation make their way to being fully banned soon enough.</p>

<p><strong>Brawl:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/221/teferi-time-raveler?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/5/c/5cb76266-ae50-4bbc-8f96-d98f309b02d3.jpg?1596451560' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
Teferi, Time Raveler
</a> is banned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once again, Teferi is just not fun to play against and locks playstyles or cards out of viability. Having constant access to him in a format like <em>Brawl</em> makes this threat omnipresent, and with him making up 10% of the field and having some of the highest win-rates, I have no qualms with him being removed from the format.</p>

<p><em>Pioneer</em> has steadily moved toward <em>Modern</em> levels of degeneracy and this B&amp;R cuts the legs out from the main pillars of the format. Inverter (comboing with 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/7/2/726e8b29-13e9-4138-b6a9-d2a0d8188d1c.jpg?1582752984' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Thassa’s Oracle
</a>) is similar to 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/5/8/580fbbf8-ba7e-4889-a5ea-d066f3ea8cea.jpg?1562262611' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Splinter Twin
</a> of <em>Modern</em>’s past, a versatile control deck with an, “Oops, I win,” combo. It is the most popular deck in the format for this and its skill-rewarding play, but this has lead to its synonymy being scorned. Inverter of Truth as a key piece and also lacking redundancy (Thassa’s Oracle can be replaced with 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/54/jace-wielder-of-mysteries?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/6/a/6adb7d73-4482-4930-8497-cffd169b57e2.jpg?1557576232' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Jace, Wielder of Mysteries
</a>) will remove the combo from the format, while preserving the shell it resides in.</p>

<p>Underworld Breach is another incredibly powerful and popular deck in the format, foregoing versatility for blistering combo degeneracy. Once again, this deck promotes no interaction and is dagnerously fast. Cutting out it’s enabler, and generally broken namesake, will cripple the combo and make <em>Pioneer</em> ultimately a more healthy format.</p>

<p>Kethis combo (oh look, another combo deck) is a small portion of the metagame, but it boasts ridiculous win-rates. Similar to 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/5dn/134/krark-clan-ironworks?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/6/c60174d6-1f9d-4870-b3db-34d6fcb3f6ab.jpg?1564535860' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Krark-Clan Ironworks
</a> in <em>Modern</em>, this deck is convoluted and extremely hard to pilot, but rewards skill and diligence with wins upon wins. Once again, no complaints from me by removing this swift and deadly combo from the format.</p>

<p>Lastly, Walking Ballista fell upon Heliod’s sword. 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/18/heliod-sun-crowned?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/0/1/01a8576e-cadc-4521-aadd-3a05f0bc4d20.jpg?1581479085' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Heliod, Sun-Crowned
</a> plus Walking Ballista makes for an early and game-ending two-card combo (I’m sensing a theme here). These decks weren’t necessarily dominant, but they would be the most efficient once the pillars listed above were removed. Ballista can be run in any deck and its potential to be broken is much more varied than Heliod’s, so I can see why it took the fall.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a huge mix-up for <em>Pioneer</em>, essentially crippling all the best decks. Once again, similar to <em>Standard</em>, I applaud hitting the issues at the root, there’s no reason for other cool cards to die for broken cards’ sin’s. Slowing down the format and removing the least interactive combos should bring back the players that have been hemmorhaging from the queues.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing how all the new metagames shake out and you can bet that we’ll be covering the brave new worlds emerging! Hit us up on social media and let us know what you think of these bans and what you’re excited to brew now! This is Julian, over and out.

                                <p>Ahhhh keywords. The slang that allows the incredibly complex and growing rules set of MTG to function. Without keywords, we’d be a verbose mess and no one would be able to adequately convey anything about how the game is played or what actions they’re taking. But keywords, over the course of 27 years have grown to be a massive and overflowing bunch as nearly every set brings two or more new mechanics.

But I don’t want to talk about Companion or Escape in today’s article. I want to throw it back to the most basic of keywords, the bread and butter of casual <em>Magic</em> that are known as ‘evergreen’ mechanics. These are the bread and butter of magic, as creatures were <em>flying</em> over to chip in for damage or <em>trampling</em> over each other long before anyone was counting cards in their graveyard for <em>Undergrowth</em> or tapping mana specifically to trigger <em>Adamant</em>.</p>

<p>Today, spurred by the keyword-matters creatures and pseudo keyword lords from Ikoria, I want to focus on three of my favorite keywords: <em>Trample</em>, <em>Menace</em>, and <em>Deathtouch</em>. Let’s dive into a build focused on each of these mechanics with the added benefit that they all completely survive rotation this Fall!

<h2 id="math-is-for-blockers">Math is for Blockers</h2>

<p>A great person once said these words, “Math is for blockers. Attack with everything.” That is the exact motto of a board full of creatures with <em>trample</em>. Our creatures are going to be bigger than our opponents, and no matter how they block, we’re going to decimate their forces and crash through for damage anyway. The centerpieces of this deck is the humble bond between a man and his dinosaur. Courtesy of Ikoria,

Proud Wildbonder, though taking away our ability to actually destroy creatures in combat, allows us to punch through damage rapidly and efficiently. And then with all that extra damage, Quartzwood Crasher triggers giving us more fat tramplers to block and then smash even more face next turn. But these two best buds want everyone to join in on the fun, which is why they’ve brought along a bunch of beefy friends to help them.</p>

<p><em>Trample</em> creatures generally are above rate so as to make use of the keyword and we have great includes all along our curve.

These two make our creatures <strong>incredibly</strong> hard to block, let alone trade with favorably (or even unfavorably). Plus our Raptor’s ability will help manage their board from getting out of control and can pump up the creatures they didn’t have enough blockers for.</p>

<p>Unlike the <em>trample</em> deck, our <em>menace</em> creatures are fast and low to the ground which helps us curve out and apply pressure quickly. A perfect example that also fuels further draws is

<p><em>Deathtouch</em> is a rarely used keyword and is usually relegated to small, insignificant creatures (except

	Grave Titan
</a>). Used to symbolize the small but deadly creatures that inhabit our own world, it’s primarily a defensive mechanic, great for stalling games with our opponent fearing losing their bomb to our deathtoucher that we’ll gladly make a trade for.</p>

<p>On the flipside, deathtouchers can also make great attackers primarily because they are so small and our opponent won’t want to trade to block, that they’ll allow us to chip in turn after turn for a considerable amount of damage. It’s these two angles that we want to maximize in this all deathtoucher’s deck!

There isn’t a ‘bonder’ from <em>Ikoria</em> to give a buff to our <em>deathtouch</em> creatures, but <em>M21</em> gave us something arguably better in

	Hooded Blightfang
</a>. Now, every attack will drain our opponent for one. Add that to the damage from them most likely not blocking and we’re looking at a three or four lifepoint swing per creature! Add on the ability to merc planeswalkers and the Blightfang is a powerhouse.

	Questing Beast
</a>. Yes, I know, we sold out. I don’t like this card either, but as a creature with <em>deathtouch</em> it’s <strong>too good</strong> to ignore. This will punch in a lot of damage for us and up our clock since most of our creatures are one or 2 power.</p>

<p>Speaking of our other creatures, here’s a slew of our rank and file deathtouchers.

                                <p>Welcome back Hexdrinkers fans! There’s a lot of things going on with our crew recently, including another new author to our team! He’s hoping to join me in the mighty world of Brawl so hopefully you’ll be hearing from him soon…in the meantime welcome to a brand new series!</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <h2>Plus40</h2>
</div>
<p><br />
For each <strong>Plus40</strong> we’ll be highlighting a Brawl Commander and a powerful deck strategy while also including what additional 40 cards will make that deck a <em>Commander</em> allstar come rotation. It’s a way to hold on to your favorite strategies and cards past the Brawl expiration date, or as a way to just level up your game into a <em>Commander</em> meta. And considering it’s a set list of 40 cards, you can transform back anytime! Our first swing at this versatile new series comes all the way from Dominaria in Core Set 2021…</p>

<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking and I was the exact same way. “Wait, a card that triggers off of card-draw … but it’s mono green. Chev. Buddy. This is a clear example of what should be in the 59 of someone with a more ‘blue’ persuasion.” And I can see the logic, BUT in this wild wild world we call standard Blue is not the only one drawing cards at ridiculous speeds. In fact, call me a heretic but between

<p>Basically what I’m saying is, there’s a chance we can build an entire two decks around green’s ability to draw cards and not even miss the islands a little bit.</p>

<p>At her core Jolrael wants to be doing two things: making cats and buffing said cats with her mana sink ability. Drawing cards will have a positive effect on both since her buff is tied to cards in hand and will make our tokens. We’ll also include some extra go-wide synergy cards to sweeten the deal. That’s pretty much it! We want to be drawing cards, and we want to be loading up on as many

</a> is the most clear-cut draw engine for singleton formats considering we’ll never have more than one creature with a given name, and once it’s down, not only will each creature cast be generating tons of extra value, but Jolrael will be able to drop cats like nobody’s business.

And what do we do once we’ve amassed so many cats we don’t know what to do with them? Well. We make them really big and we bap our opponent on the nose so violently they concede in a flurry of whiskers. Ideally, we’re using Jolrael’s ability to give everyone +x/+x on a hefty hand, but everyone needs backup.

That being said, it will always pay to have a suite of top-tier interaction and win-cons for when the going gets rough.

<p>Thaaaaat’s right everyone it’s time for the <em>Commander</em> build. Now, obviously there are cards that could be swapped out of our Brawl baby for a more intense final product but that’s not what this is about, son! We’re talking a straight Brawl DLC! This is like a season pass to all things Jolrael that can just be combined with your existing list for that little extra oomph!</p>

<p>We’ll be sticking with the same themes: drawing more than once per turn and going wide, but adding the more powerful older siblings to a lot of our Brawl picks. Add a classic package of protection and removal to round things out.</p>

<p>Well, we won’t be causing any confusion about what we’re against or what we’re for, we’re FOR drawing a ridiculous number of cards. We’re AGAINST our opponents being able to do anything about it.</p>

<p>So far we’ve kind of stayed in the lanes designated by our Brawl build, but while Brawl is improved by the innovation required by a smaller card pool, Commander really shines due to the sheer volume of synergies available in lanes that haven’t been printed in a while.</p>

<p>Lavinia’s high impact passive effect and low casting cost make her a threat right out of the gate. Regardless of the level your table typically plays at there are great options for Lavinia, which makes her perfect for this series. Our budget deck will be up first today, focusing on a combination between group hug and pillow fort strategies. With this we’re hoping to win a resource battle against the last player left. Until then we’ll be encouraging our opponents to bring each other down, while we slowly turtle up. The second deck today will be our high power deck and will focus on locking our opponents out with

<p>As usual, the budget version of the deck should cost you under $200. I know the tapped out says it will be more, but it’s pricing Islands at $2.50. Don’t buy islands for that much, and please report anyone selling them to you at this rate to the Azorius Senate. Anyway, our plan will be to discourage our opponents from attacking us, while giving them the resources to kill each other. When asked for a quote about her commander style

<p>But in order to get this far in the first place, we’re going to need to get the shields up and stay safe till we feel comfortable entering the fray. Our opponents are going to see Azorius and just immediately put us at target number one. It’s okay, they don’t understand the full glory of blue white. Anyway, when they start to get the lead out, it’s time to pillow up or shut up.</p>

<p>We can also more actively try to lockdown the game with some cards that pump the breaks on our opponents for whole turns.

	Lavinia of the Tenth
</a> slots into this category well and will allow us to stop opponents from attacking with any of their smaller creatures for a turn. This version of Lavinia’s <em>Detain</em> effect even prevents mana abilities from being activated. One turn lockdowns aren’t going to be enough though, let’s look at some continuous effects that really shut our opponents down.

	Angelic Arbiter
</a> both force our opponents to decide if they want to cast spells or attack each turn and can be massively disruptive if played correctly. As a bonus if these somehow prevent other players from winning or making big tempo plays, the other folks at the table may even appreciate these cards (don’t count on it though). Lockdown doesn’t always send a strong enough message though, sometimes we need destruction.

	Karmic Justice

<p>Eventually, things will inevitably get out of hand with one of our opponents, so we’ll need to be able to reset them to a position where our taxes and fees will keep us safe.

	Single Combat
</a> can help us clear off the board without completely losing everything. Either everything ends up back in people’s decks, ours included, or we get to keep a key creature, like Lavinia, on the board.

	Tragic Arrogance
</a> is a great card to sub in if either of these don’t fit your style. Not every problem requires the nuclear option though, sometimes we can pinpoint a key permanent that is offsetting the balance of things. For that, targeted removal will be our best friend. 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/37/winds-of-abandon?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/3/b/3bb17913-fe4d-4acd-9b75-71f5a90f898b.jpg?1562201278' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Winds of Abandon
</a> is a great middle ground here, allowing us to either shut it all down, or nail a key target. For our dedicated single target removal, we still like that idea of keeping the balance.

	Generous Gift

	Fractured Identity
</a> leans in the other direction. If someone pulls out way ahead by dropping a game ending creature, just teach them that sharing is caring and spread that wealth around the table. One last card I want to highlight is 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/c16/71/oblation?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/8/c8ed494e-e285-4baf-bc8f-b7f5a0a1b58a.jpg?1562419093' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Oblation
</a> which is still great removal, but also hints toward the other archetype we’re mixing into this deck, <em>Group Hug</em>.</p>

<p>Group hug is another strategy that tries to push the aggression off of you. But this time it does so by giving the other players resources and playing symmetrical effects. You can usually negotiate your way out of any early aggression using these effects. Later, you might be able to exchange some of that goodwill for help on cards like

<p>This is a new section I’ll be adding to each of these articles, where I give a brief rundown on how to identify a good starting hand and how to make use of it. For this deck we don’t really have any ramp outside of a few artifacts and our average CMC is a bit high. So, we’ll be looking for three to four mana sources in our starting hand. This will ensure that even if we don’t see lands for a little while we can keep playing on curve. After that, make sure that you have one or two cards that can help keep you safe in the short term. These could come from the <em>Pillow Fort</em> or the <em>Group Hug</em> category, we just want a way to put the shields up early. After that we will be looking for either draw or a long term plan. If we can find a consistent draw engine we’ll be well stocked with resources into the midgame. If we have one of our win cons or another high value spell we can try to politic our way into making that as high impact as possible. Take a look below for the full decklist with a small sideboard of other cards you may want to include.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve served half my sentence.. Uh I mean, now that I’m halfway done with my volunteer work, onto the second deck of this article! This second deck isn’t meant to lock down the first time mana-cheating offenders, this deck is meant to lay down the law against the serious rule breakers.

	Ravages of War
</a>; I’m not. In my opinion there are good ways to spend $150 improving your deck and bad ways to do it. Including that card over another one of our spells wouldn’t dramatically change our win rate and could even reduce it depending on the meta. It’s not worth it.</p>

<p>The final element of this deck I want to highlight is the cards that help us in the resource battle. As a control deck we are often trading down, going one for one with different opponents. Our stax pieces will help slow down the other players at the table, but that’s still not enough.

<h2 id="i-am-the-senate">I AM THE SENATE:</h2>
<p>In this version of the deck we have a lower CMC and a lot of artifact ramp. I would still look for three mana sources or fetch lands, but place a stronger emphasis on having some amount of artifact ramp in the hand. Once you’re comfortable with that, we need to have some early counter magic. Other players are going to start looking for the win as soon as their first turn, so we need to be ready to stop them. In the same vein we’ll need one or two of our early stax pieces to deny our opponents the ability to look for that early win. Finally, resource generation is still important. Once we’ve blown through our opening hand, which will be very fast, we need to be able to reload and keep up the pressure. In conclusion, you’re priorities in order are:</p>

<p>The full deck list is given below. Well, now that I am done with my <em>volunteer work</em> I think I’m gonna hop off this plane for a bit. Maybe take a tour of Eldraine. I heard Syr something or other was hosting a party and those are always a fun time. See you next week!</p>

                                <p>Welcome back to another article in <em>The Top Shelf</em> series. This week we will be dipping back into the well of commander precons. <em>C20</em> featured the return of <em>Partners with</em>, a mechanic I found very interesting and was happy to see again. I think that <em>Partners with</em> outshines the original <em>Partners</em> mechanic because it allows the design team to build in bespoke synergies or game plans with a lower risk of accidentally creating something overpowered. In an effort to branch out from my comfort colors of Naya, I’ll be looking at a Sultai deck this week! (I won’t give up green, you can’t make me. I have rights!)</p>

<p>There are a few all-star cards when it comes to +1/+1 counters we get to include that I’m very excited about.

	Reyhan, Last of the Abzan
</a> is great at saving the counters from our dying creatures and getting them back on Ukkima where they belong.

	Forgotten Ancient
</a> also does a great job of sharing the wealth of +1/+1 counters, eventually funneling them onto our favorite Whale Wolf.

	Hydra’s Growth
</a> let us stomp on the gas and kill our opponents much faster by just doubling the counters on Ukkima. Speaking of killing our opponents quickly… Don’t tell anyone I told you, but

	Tainted Strike
</a> is super gross in this deck and you should absolutely run it. I can’t say it’ll win you friends but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t win games.</p>

<p>Now that Ukkima is big, we’ve painted a target on our backs. People will try to lock him down but may be careful about killing him for fear of the damage he’ll do when he dies. I expect to see a fair amount of hate aimed at us as soon as Ukkima’s any larger than 6/6. We can always try to prevent his destruction, but then we have to go through the whole rigmarole that is the commander tax and dodging counterspells. Instead let’s just swerve that and blink that boi!

<p>So, we have our battle plan and our pack (pod? pock? We’ll stick with pack) behind us. Now let’s start circling in for the kill. Blue and black are going to give us the ability to easily disrupt our opponent’s game plan as we are working on our own.

	Plunge Into Darkness
</a> will allow us to seek specific combo pieces or key cards we need in a moment. These cards are very powerful, but if you play in a meta where chip damage and life total is relevant they should probably be used as a last resort to either lock in your win or stop someone else’s. Almost all of our tutors will be split between those that only find creatures and those that can help us find anything we’d like.

<h2 id="cazur-is-still-here-kinda">Cazur is Still Here… Kinda</h2>
<p>Unlike the more casual version of the deck, Cazur is probably not going to be in play much. He does offer his friend Ukkima certain benefits though, if you know what I mean… Yeah, I’m talking about green ramp. We’ll be stuffing our deck to the gills with mana dorks and other spells to speed up our curve.

<p>To be clear, Cazur isn’t just in the deck to activate our ramp cards. He also turns on some of our powerful interaction spells.

	Autumn’s Veil
</a>. As nice as it is that Cazur is here to hang out, let’s just have another round of applause for Ukkima allowing us to run the powerful counterspells and tech cards in UB.</p>

<h2 id="your-opponents-trying-to-win-just-say-no">Your Opponents Trying to Win? Just Say No.</h2>
<p>Counterspells are one of the most powerful tools in magic. “Counter target spell” is up there for the three best words to put on a card. So let’s take a look at some of the best counterspells for the format, the ones you don’t even have to spend mana on! 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/52/force-of-negation?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/9/e9be371c-c688-44ad-ab71-bd4c9f242d58.jpg?1562201382' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Force of Negation
</a> is unbelievably powerful, while hitting the wallet a bit more gently than 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/49/force-of-will?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/b/ebc01ab4-d89a-4d25-bf54-6aed33772f4b.jpg?1580013954' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Force of Will
</a>. If you have both, I would absolutely suggest running them in tandem but I’ll be sticking with Negation. Speaking of negation, 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/68/pact-of-negation?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/d/d/dd125949-38c4-470f-9128-b80c45621086.jpg?1562442064' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Pact of Negation
</a> is great for winning the game, when there won’t be a next turn.

	Narset’s Reversal

<p>Finally, I just want to offer a quick blurb about some fun (for us, not for our opponents) cards I’ve made room for in this deck. 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/61/narset-parter-of-veils?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/8/c/8c39f9b4-02b9-4d44-b8d6-4fd02ebbb0c5.jpg?1574294103' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Narset, Parter of Veils
</a> is the first card that pops into my head as this girl is rude. Remember 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/202/leovold-emissary-of-trest?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/e/cedfc5b7-9242-4680-b284-debc8b5a9bc7.jpg?1559959275' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Leovold, Emissary of Trest
</a>? This has the same unbelievably cursed effect and dodges creature specific removal. Is your opponent looking for a win out of the yard? Maybe they’re about to resurrect 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/hou/73/razaketh-the-foulblooded?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/1/e14adff9-33cc-467e-b782-068854c5e7b7.jpg?1562817745' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Razaketh the Foulblooded
</a> before you’ve even had a turn?

	Faerie Macabre
</a> is here to help you shut that down. One last option I’ve thrown in is 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/76/gilded-drake?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/8/d/8de3fdae-cc2c-4a14-b15b-4fe1a983dfbf.jpg?1562924943' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Gilded Drake
</a>. This is a highly meta-dependent call. I run into a fair amount of hatebears, value generating creatures, and other problematic things that this helps address. There have been some other meta-dependent or potentially budget-busting cards I’ve called out here so there’s a pretty big maybeboard for this deck. Take a look at it and see if there are any cards you think you’d rather include. The full list is below.</p>

<p>Alright! That’s all folks! Thanks a ton for reading through this article. I wish you good luck and happy hunting with either of these decks. If you have any commander’s you’d like to see me go over in future articles like this, let me know in the comments or on <em>Hexdrinkers</em> Twitter. Next week I’ll be going over yet another Naya commander, as it is the best color combination… Hold on, I think I hear someone ringing <em>The Hexdrinkers</em> doorbell. Looks like the Azorius Senate.

With Wizards announcing recently that Brawl will now be available every day for <em>free</em> and Historic Brawl seeing a little more attention from the big guys upstairs, we are truly living in a Golden Age. It does bring up the question of will we still be seeing powerful old legends backfilled into the format like we did in the Guildhalls. For now I’m going to revel in the ability to play my favorite format every day!</p>

<p>So, let’s celebrate the only way I know how… brewing a new deck chock full synergy, power, and a dash of ruthlessness.  I’m about to make a deck you can’t refuse…</p>

<p>My family has <em>finally</em> gotten around to watching the Corleone crime saga and if nothing else is bringing us together in Quarantine, it’s Michael cleaning house of the snitches and hooligans that have tried to have him and his family killed. As Godfather he continues to create a crime empire that spans the country and knows no rivals.</p>

<p>That might be a little out of scope for a deck build, but here at Hexdrinkers world domination is never far from our mind…instead we’ll focus on Michael’s inspiration for his long lasting empire! Nothing Al Pacino does would be possible without the foundation laid by his father, Vito.</p>

	Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose
</a> and lemme tell ya, I’m impressed. Taking a classic <em>Magic</em> enchantment like

	Sanguine Bond
</a>, throwing it on a stick for two mana less is great. With the right crew, I don’t think it’ll take much to reach Vito’s maximum potential and before long our opponents will be sleeping with the fishes.</p>

<h2 id="one-for-me-two-for-you">One for Me, Two For You</h2>

<p>Ah pinging, the shin-kicks of <em>Magic</em>. Always annoying and not lethal by itself but still capable of inflicting a serious amount of damage. With Vito out, that trouble is doubled. Think of these guys as the street level enforcers.</p>

For each life gained, we’ll be dealing more damage directly to our opponents, essentially halving their clock with one of these repeatable engines on the board.</p>

	Ill-Gotten Inheritance
</a></strong> was a draft all star, ending games if you didn’t have an answer. While it’s a little slow for Standard, it fits just perfectly into our Vito shell. Add on the sac ability to potentially deal <strong>eight damage</strong> to our opponent?? This card should definitely not be taken lightly.</p>

	Dread Presence
</a></strong> requires a couple land drops, but for the ability to deal two-to-four damage per turn outside of combat, this is not a hard condition to meet. Also, if Vito is currently unavailable - locked in his office listening to the plea of a fishmonger (since no Sicilian can deny a request on his daughter’s wedding day), Dread Presence can be drawing you an extra card per turn

</a>. In most decks, terrible. In the long run you’ll be gaining just as much life as you’re losing and the odds just aren’t worth it. But, <em>but</em>, in a deck that capitalizes on the mere act of gaining life this card is pretty buckwild. Consider the average of gaining six life every other turn, now consider that with Vito on the board. We’re going to be dealing six damage directly to our opponents on a fairly regular basis without even attacking! Even if it takes us a few turns to start the pain train, this deck sports enough life gain to make the sacrifice worth it.</p>

<p>…And of course in some games, you’ll be hitting your opponent for sixevery turn. <strong>Editor’s note: This is coming from a guy who runs

<p>Pinging is all well and good, but things really start getting scary when we’re gaining lots of life <em>on purpose</em>. Primarily, this means creatures with lifelink swinging in or making use of Vito’s secondary ability.</p>

All good things must eventually come to an end, and our games are no exception. After a while, it becomes tiring playing with our opponent’s life total, toying with them, and now it’s time to deal the killing blow.

A humble and overlooked uncommon, Griffin Aerie is simple yet efficient in its design and it almost epitomizes what I want to do in <em>Magic</em>. At two mana, it can come down early and isn’t a big investment that sets us back if it quickly gets removed or bounced (<em>cough cough</em>

	Offspring’s Revenge
</a> <em>cough cough</em>). It doesn’t have any activated abilities, just a singular sentence detailing a simple requirement with a simple payoff: you gain three life on your turn, we’ll let you enlist a feathered friend from our aerie.</p>

<p>Griffin Aerie isn’t a card that’s over the top, and its condition isn’t insurmountable. It’s fairly easy to trigger just by engaging in combat with lifelink or playing spells that have incidental lifegain, several of which exist in <em>Standard</em>. In return, the payoff is moderate. A 2/2 with flying is pretty good, but it’s nothing ridiculous and it’s hard to truly abuse. Griffin Aerie is a card that sits there and allows you to play like normal and given some deckbuilding considerations will provide a fat stack of advantage over the course of the game. Beautiful.

<p>So we already have our rough gameplan: gain at least three life a turn and that will keep us alive while we beat face with an army of eagle-lion-things, more commonly known as griffins. Currently in <em>Standard</em> there are a surprising number of cards that gain us exactly three life.

This Bant list does a lot of cool things and plays a lot of powerful cards, but during my research I thought I would be remiss if I didn’t give a second take. Black has such a deep pool as we discussed earlier and would provide a different play experience. Plus some of my favorite cards from the research phases are in black and I need to show them some love.

                                <p>Hey crew! So we’ve got a bit of a different article set-up for you today. In an effort to promote the differences between our deck-building and theory-crafting, we’ve decided to put together a brand new series called <em>DUEL DECKS</em>! Basically, we’ll be picking up the slack for Wizards who dropped the classic Duel Decks line a couple years ago with our own crazy builds featuring the best of match-ups. To start things off, we thought we’d jump right into the ridiculously powerful <em>Core Set 2021</em> that was just released…</p>

<p>You see, we’ve been having a bit of an argument over the superior household animal and I need your help proving him wrong once and for all. That’s right. Chev and his felines are facing off against Julian’s canines: it’s <strong>Cats Versus Dogs</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s right, a freaking savage, world-roaring CAT! Where were dogs Julian? Probably out sniffing their butts or something. Arahbo ushered in a new era for cat-kind in our favorite casual format by not only being an absolute stud, but also finding ways to provide value wherever our furry friend ends up thanks to eminence. He is exactly what cats need to conquer the multiverse! Muwahahaha… huh? Who said that? Let’s uhh, let’s take a look at the deck!</p>

	Arahbo, Roar of the World
</a> always allows us to buff one cat per turn +3/+3, but if he’s on the board, we <em>also</em> can pay {1}{G}{W} for each attacking cat to double its power and toughness. Okay, that’s pretty beast. I mean common household aggro name

<p>To best utilize Arahbo’s bounty of beautiful abilities we want to lean heavily on the aggressive nature of our commander and be dropping cats left and right. I want to overwhelm our enemies with cuddly cuteness and claws of steel. Luckily, most cats tend to agree.</p>

<p>There are a bajillion ways to generate cat tokens in this deck, these are just the top few. Even better, a lot of the token generation doesn’t even involve tapping, so we can ball out on the attack and still come back with double the number of war-ready cheetahs. (Well, unless you’re poor Pride Sovereign who finds generating tokens so strenuous they have to take two turns off to recover. Taking a nap, drinking some Eternal’s blood, whatever Amonkhet cats do) This allows us to utilize the benefits of Arahbo the most, by giving us as many targets as possible with doubled stats, if we have the mana to back that up. Once we do, this can easily start snowballing.</p>

<p>Of course, you might be a little hesitant to spend your mana doubling the power of a legion of 1/1s. Hey I don’t blame yah. Good thing we got lords for DAYZ. Be they true feline or leonin, cats have been getting buffed since the early 2000s. Dogs…I mean, they got

Taking advantage of the absolutely bonkers way the companion mechanic is integrating with <em>Commander</em>, i.e. allowing us a 101st card, this allows Kaheera to be an essential 9th card in our starting hand meaning instant lord access. Yes, the companion change means I need to drum up 3 mana first to get Kaheera into my hand but she’s still suuuper powerful. And we’re in green so like, nbd.</p>

<div class="text-center"><h1>Dogs</h1></div>
<p>The domesticated portion of the canine family tree that we know as dogs have been called many things; fluffers, floofers,woofers, puppies, doggos, good boys and girls, just to name a few. But <strong>never</strong> have they been called <em>hounds</em>. This was a mistake that <em>Magic</em> had been making since the game’s inception (minus Zodiac Dog, <em>Portal</em> was weird). But the release of <em>Core 2021</em> and <em>Jumpstart</em> we have been given a blessing in the errata of the <em>hound</em> creature type to <em>dog</em>.</p>

    <div class="text-center">

    </div>
    
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>And with this change, <em>Wizards</em> has started to give doggos the love that they deserve in the form of true tribal support, something that those wretched cats have been receiving en masse for the past few years . And most of the cat tribal support until just recently derives from lion men being a thing in <em>Magic</em> for forever, which I think is a little unfair. I believe dogs and wolves (both the <em>were</em> and non-<em>were</em> varieties) should be able to run in the same pack, but alas. As a proud dog owner and lover since I was born, it’s only natural that I remind the world who the best pets are with a dog-themed <em>Commander</em> deck! And also I want to put Chev in his place…</p>

<h2 id="a-bite-to-back-up-the-bark">A Bite to Back Up the Bark</h2>

<p>Dogs come in all different breeds, and despite there only being a measly 89 dogs printed in the game’s nearly 30 year history, they can be found in all 5 colors! Since dogs have been printed so sparingly, <em>Wizards</em> hasn’t had time to really find the sweet spot on canine design. I’m not gonna sugarcoat it: most of these cards aren’t… competitive.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that dogs love to do, it’s play! Cats are lame. They just sit around, do their own thing, and only seek human attention when it’s dinner time. Dogs want love, affection, and for their owner to stop playing arena and go outside to throw a bone or ball. (Of course since this is a war against the feline menace, we generally will be playing with sharper and pointier toys, but we do have a few balls to toss.)</p>

                                <p>Welcome back one and all to the fourth installment of <em>On the Rocks</em>! Jund Food was so much fun last time and piloting it reminded me of the power, but also the fun play patterns, of <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> cards (yes yes, I know there are some who would beg to differ).</p>

<p>With that on the mind, I decided to virtually sleeve up an <em>Adventure</em> deck, but not one that’s been in the limelight. This time we’re playing Naya Adventures! I love the

I am being brought on to add a new voice and additional perspectives to <em>Hexdrinkers</em>. You can read more about me and find other articles by me on my author page here (https://hexdrinkers.com/authors/eric.html)! <em>The Top Shelf</em> is a new series, focusing on unique commanders that have exciting potential in both competitive and casual magic. There are a lot of commanders that fall into this category but we’ll start with one that I have been interested in for a long time:

Her ability initially makes you wonder what ‘Eggs ‘are there in <em>Magic</em> and how good are they? Don’t let the eggs fool you though, for the competitive build we’re looking at today the real eggs aren’t eggs at all. Instead they are Changelings! Creature’s with the Changeling ability count as eggs, which is just fine for our purpose.</p>

<p>Atla was originally a secondary commander in C19. The base deck was designed to continuously create and copy tokens. Jumping off from that point would typically make you think of creatures that make tokens or a large battlecruiser deck that cheats some mana through sacrificing eggs. We’ll even be going into one of those later in this article. But for now, we’re going to look at Atla as a combo focused commander.

<h2 id="im-not-even-yolking-it-works">I’m not Even Yolking, It Works</h2>

<p>Atla has a bespoke combo that works with her triggered ability. It requires us to run the following cards:

	Mirror Entity
</a>, a card that does damage when it enters or leaves the battlefield, and a card which can shuffle our graveyard back in when it dies. Additionally, Atla needs to have either a temporary stat bonus for the turn or a +1/+1 counter. The good news is that we only need Atla,

This will set the toughness of all your creatures to zero and makes them all eggs, but Atla will survive due to the buffs we just gave her. Mirror Entity will die and cause the next creature in your deck to flip onto the field. It too will be an egg with zero toughness, so it’ll die and rotate out as well. This repeats until we run out of creatures. We can loop this process by shuffling our graveyard back into the deck with a card like

Offense isn’t going to be enough to get us across the line though. On the scale of cEDH decks, we don’t expect to keep up with Tier 0 decks, but we do need to be able to stop some decks faster than ours. In order to do this we’ll be running a light stax package to compete with those strategies. But not to worry, we won’t hurt our own game plan too much.

<p>Now, for the final question: How are we going to find and play all these cards we just talked about? To play our main combo in one turn is a minimum of eight mana, including four colored mana (WWRG). In order to find all our pieces and have the mana to play them, ramp and tutors are going to be key.</p>

<p>We run an interesting mix of ramp packages to make sure that our hate cards (and those of our opponents) don’t end up hitting us too hard. Mana dorks, such as

Well, that is all on our competitive deck. With this guide on the build you can feel free to make your own meta dependent switches. In the sideboard of the deck I call out a few helpful cards that can be subbed in depending on budget and meta. Even if your first few matches end up being a bit scrambled or hard boiled, I’m sure you’ll be winning matches over easy in no time! (I’m not even close to sorry about the egg puns).</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back now that we’ve finished one of our decks. We originally said this commander would be great for a less competitive build focused on eggs, tokens, and the sweet sweet taste of battlecruiser magic. Well, I’m excited to let you know that’s exactly what we’re talking about next. This build is going to run you under $200 and should fit in a more casual and/or combat focused meta.

And that’s it! All the Naya eggs. Wait, that’s it? <em>Frantically checking notes.</em> That can’t be it, right? How are we going to make this deck work with four eggs? Well, we’re going to have to rely on Atla’s slightly underwhelming activated ability for the most part. But, we still have some good news coming!

	Nesting Dragon
</a> is able to crank out at least an egg a turn while we’re hitting our land drops. Additionally, there are a few changelings that we can run to fill in our empty nest.</p>

What if we clone our eggs?. Atla and Nesting Dragon both make egg tokens, so populating and doubling tokens can be very powerful for us… Of course a lot of token doublers would bust our budget pretty hard, but

<p>Well, now it’s time to hatch those eggs and find out just what is inside! In order to cycle through these eggs fast enough to see our powerful cards, we’re going to need some sacrifice outlets or ways to crack these eggs. In Naya we don’t have a ton of options, but they definitely exist. For example,

We’re going to be running a pretty tight selection of creatures so that every time we crack an egg we either get another egg or a powerful creature. Enter the battlefield triggers will really help exaggerate the effects we get from cheating mana.

<p>I think there’s some bad news coming though… We may not always get to turn a bunch of eggs into massive creatures at little to no cost. We may at some point need to start paying for these monsters, so mana ramp is going to be a prominent feature of our deck. Unfortunately we don’t get to use mana dorks because seeing one come out of an egg may actually break my heart.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the land ramp.

Well, that concludes my analysis on this version of the deck. I tried to keep this to a budget that made sense to me, but I remember hating spending money on lands when I could get some game winning eight-drops for the same price. I’ve offered some higher end suggestions in the maybe board of the deck list. Feel free to make any substitutions you’d like though! This is a deck that can be driven in pretty much any direction. Tribal and Token themes could be more pronounced if that appealed to you. If you have any commanders you’d like to see me do an analysis of like this or any thoughts on the series feel free to let us know on Twitter or in the comments below! Thanks so much for the read and see you next time on <em>The Top Shelf</em>!</p>

                                <p><em>After much back and forth and a few fist-fights we were able to score a one-of-a-kind interview with The Hexdrinkers’ very own Chev Eldrid, and Julian Leal. They claim no one else even wanted to interview them…preposterous. Here is our unedited question section from that interview. Enjoy:</em></p>

<p><strong>Q: Wow, THE Julian Leal and Chev Eldrid? It’s so good to finally meet you! I’ve been following you guys ever since that welcome article and continue to come back two times a week!</strong></p>

<p>JL: …Chev, what’s going on? Aren’t you the one writing this?</p>

<p>CE: What? No, this is a very unbiased reporter who is also a big fan of ours. I’m just happy we could make the time for them. Please, continue.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Thank you Chev. Now we’ve known Hexdrinkers as a brand first, and its people second. Obviously Julian is the one responsible for classics like the “On The Rocks” series and Chev has really taken to the MTGA Brawl format, but aside from the writing we don’t know much about you both.</strong></p>

<p>JL: Yes we’re very private people. That’s why we like to keep our Twitter account as a single follower and keep our site relatively unlisted on Google. It’s what has helped us really cultivate our “elusive” persona.</p>

<p><strong>Q: That can’t possibly be on purpose.</strong></p>

<p>CE: …psh yeah it totally is, shut up.</p>

<p>Q: Anyway, I’ve gathered a set of questions that I hope will shed some more light on who you two are, your favorite experiences with magic, and what makes you two unique in the world of mtg content producers. So with that I’d love to get started?</p>

<p>JL: Perfect!</p>

<p><strong>Question 1: You both joined the game in the Khans block, right? What would you say has been your favorite standard set since joining in 2015?</strong></p>

<p>JL: It has to be what we started with: Dragons of Tarkir. So many interesting and flashy cards, especially the Dragon Lords. That’s how our LGS tempted us into trying <em>Magic</em> out. I’ve always loved  3-color decks since then and the abundance of legendaries helped us transition nicely into Commander. That was like the wild west back then, but it was super fun, figuring out how to actually play and trying out innocent fun brews before we knew anything about ‘tiers’ and ‘metas’. It’s that sort of style that we want to emulate and recreate.</p>

<p>CE: I think I’d have to go with Dominaria. For me, even though the full history of Dominaria didn’t resonate with me as well as more enfranchised players, I still recognized a lot of the characters like

	Karn, Scion of Urza
</a>. Dominaria was also the height of my paper involvement in the game thanks to a really welcoming FNM community when I was studying in New Zealand and the incredible amount of Brawl I played with

	Tetsuko Umezawa, Fugitive
</a>. 10/10 Would do it again.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2: Starting from one base color, what color combinations do you most resonate with up through the shards/wedges?</strong></p>

<p>JL: Blue for me. Yup, I’m <strong>that guy</strong> in our playgroup, despite not playing <em>that</em> many counterspells. I’ve always been a Johnny, and being able to play at instant speed, ready to react to any situation as well as creatively set up awesome plays and win-cons is exactly where I want to be. My first decks were prowess decks with big flyers and then transitioned into Simic value in Commander. 
Secondarily, it’s a toss-up between black and white, but I have to go with white, making me Azorius. White has everything I want in a support color as a control player. Powerful removal, excellent sideboard cards, and a few big flashy fliers to close out the game (I had a notorious angel deck in the early days of our playgroup).</p>

<p>CE: Ask him why it was notorious, the answer may surprise you.</p>

<p>JL: …Lastly, my shard identity would be Esper. My longest standing commander deck is 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/me1/143/dakkon-blackblade?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/2/3/235bbf86-02ad-497b-b698-e60930bbde9c.jpg?1559592413' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Dakkon Blackblade
</a> control and my first “favorite” deck was Esper Dragons from Standard during Khans block and Origins. The combination of being able to deal with any permanent that hits the battlefield and the card advantage of blue and black is right where I want to be. Plus it includes some of my all time favorite cards

	Anguished Unmaking
</a>.
That being said, I’ve found homes in all colors and am actively working to move outside my comfort zone in all formats….. But if I had my way, I’d play Esper Control whenever I could.</p>

<p>CE: While I initially leaned green, thanks to an absolutely bonkers Elf duel deck…I’ve definitely shifted more towards black in recent years as a primary color. I really like the idea of success at any cost. Sacrificing your own creatures or using your own life as a resource to get ahead. That philosophy actually inspired the

	Selenia, Dark Angel
</a> Commander deck I’ve had for years and still love piloting: take yourself down to near zero life just to swap with someone else. It’s all about using your own stability to take others down with you. 
I pick green back up in the two color identity, always having been a big fan of the Golgari utilizing that black theme and adding the warped growth of green when paired with black. This is especially true when looking at my 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/akh/199/hapatra-vizier-of-poisons" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/5/6/56fbbcc9-db23-4902-b0f7-cea78a2a36af.jpg?1543676055' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons
</a> commander deck. Inflicting those -1/-1s upon myself and my armies to slowly wither you down with deathtouch snakes. It’s a riot!
Lastly, I would say that Abzan is my three-color. I have the least amount of attachment to this identity but it was my first theme deck purchase with 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/pktk/179/ivorytusk-fortress" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/6/1/61bf8fd7-a0bd-43f2-85c0-9b4ea06edcfc.jpg?1562701622' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Ivorytusk Fortress
</a> back in Khans, and I continue to find myself scheming with Abzan commanders…even if none ever get assembled.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3: Is there any particular card in the game that you have particularly strong memories of? Good or bad.</strong></p>

<p>JL: <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/emn/136/mirrorwing-dragon?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/4/b/4b7e33a8-765b-4909-a5c6-5fe8f8774a51.jpg?1576384631' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Mirrorwing Dragon
</a> from Eldritch Moon. That card is sweeeeeet. It was the centerpiece of the first Standard deck that I brewed and fully built to play at FNM. The deck consisted of a bunch of good rate creatures and efficient pump spells so you could target the dragon and buff your whole team like crazy and swing out. The deck did reasonably well, was a lot of fun to play, and was a big personal victory for my deck-building infancy.</p>

<p>CE: Oh, easily

	Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger

	Animar, Soul of Elements
</a>. Eldrazi Tribal deck has always been one of my favorites, and I’m really hoping for some new tech in the fall Zendikar set. But yeah, Ulamog started it all.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4: If you had to forge a life somewhere in the multiverse, what plane would you most want to find yourself on?</strong></p>

<p>JL: Shandalar. It’s a “rogue plane,” it drifts through the Multiverse doing it’s own thing and not much is known about that. I like that sort of vibe and I like the peaceful and serene lifestyle of being off the beaten path, communing with nature, etc. Also, it’s super mana rich and all the artwork from there looks gorgeous, so it’d be great for someone who likes to be outside like myself.</p>

<p>CE: I think…Kaladesh. Post Aether Revolt. Just an absolutely beautiful aesthetic that was brought to life in one of Magic storytellings more successful runs. As a software developer, I love the idea of a plane with technology built into its very core and as a set it introduced so many cool new cards and ideas (including a bunch of bannings but hey,

	Die Young
</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Question 5: What excites you most currently about Magic as a whole?</strong></p>

<p>JL: The breadth of ways to play. In the beginning we just lumped whatever cards we had together and fought it out in our basements. Then we jumped into Commander, later on started drafting, and now I’m playing competitively in Standard on Arena. We dabbled in other formats, but there’s still so many ways to play Magic that I want to experience and become knowledgeable about.</p>

<p>CE: Currently? I’d say the depth. As we’re trying to start this website with our own ideas and views - we’re constantly discovering new strategies or archetypes that we can really sink our teeth into without stepping on too many toes. There’s always more to discover and explore.</p>

<p><strong>Question 6: So, we all know the Player Archetypes of Magic, but which do you think most resonate with you?</strong></p>

<p>JL: I said this earlier, but definitely Johnny.</p>

<p>CE: Johnny, with a side of Vorthos. Julian will be the first to tell you of my propensity to play “bad cards” because I feel they either fall on-theme or I think they have more potential than they really do. Just ask him about

<p>With multiple incredible engines (ooh my favorite), this deck has been a powerful force in Standard since the release of <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> only to fall off during Companion Spring (doesn’t have the same ring as Eldrazi Winter, does it?). Recently resurfacing with the recent bannings and rules change, has it returned to its former glory (the answer is not quite, but it’s still good).</p>

	Ugin, the Spirit Dragon
</a> showing up again in $4 packs. I mean come on!!! Almost makes a man want to buy a box. Can’t be as bad as the Origins boxes Julian and I opened a little over 5 years ago…can it?</p>

<p>Over these next couple weeks before release, we at Hexdrinkers thought we’d focus on some of the <em>new</em> cards joining us this summer. One of which has also inspired the first mono-red commander deck I’ve ever put together. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FORRRRR SUBIRA, TULZIDI CARAVANNER!</p>

<div>
    
    <div class="text-center">
        <img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/0/3/034b8d6d-95ea-434a-967a-e6675a7ce88a.jpg?1591972641" style="max-width: 33%;" class="img-fluid" />
    </div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>She’s got haste, she’s got the ability to make our mini-minions unblockable, AND has a pretty handy take on red card draw. Get it? Handy? Ahhh I wonder if Julian will let that through editing <strong>EDITOR’S NOTE: (I did, I am sorry - Julian)</strong>. Let’s take Subira’s textbox line-by-line while we start to form some ideas on how to build a deck that most accurately shows off this new legend’s power.</p>

<h2 id="break-it-down">Break it Down</h2>

<p><b><em>Haste</em></b> <br />
Okay maybe we don’t need to spend so much time on this one BUT it does help highlight the aggressive nature of this no-nonsense caravan leader. You know we’ll be swinging on turn 3 at whoever still doesn’t have a creature out. There’s always one.</p>

<p><b><em>{1}: Another target creature with power 2 or less can’t be blocked this turn.</em> </b><br />
This is probably going to be the most important line on the entire card. Subira wants as many small creatures attacking as possible, but we’ll need the mana to pay for it. This seems like a less conditional, but more restrictive version of another Jamuraa legend we saw in C16, 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/c16/42/sidar-kondo-of-jamuraa?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/1/9/19d2671c-39bd-4dd7-ac97-9cdf5c2cb149.jpg?1562390224' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Sidar Kondo of Jamuraa
</a>. While that version doesn’t require an activation cost, I don’t think Sidar Kondo is nearly as powerful as Subira, and we’ll get to why in a minute. I also want to point out that Subira’s ability says <strong>another</strong> target creature can’t be blocked. So no shenanigans with a self-target and pumping for commander damage.</p>

<p><b><em>{1}{R}, {T}, Discard Your Hand: Until end of turn, whenever a creature you control with power 2 or less deals combat damage to a player, draw a card.</em> </b><br />
Ooooo boy. Okay. This whole “whenever a creature deals combat damage, draw a card” is not an ability we generally see in red. Like, at all. From a couple informed Scryfall searches I couldn’t find a single example of this ability being used outside of blue and green with cards like 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/42/bident-of-thassa?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/5/9/5903aac6-171c-48b7-984a-f074c176d179.jpg?1562435903' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Bident of Thassa
</a> and 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/163/keeper-of-fables?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/6/7/6754d6cf-3506-48b5-a0ef-8a90b8dd2701.jpg?1572490595' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Keeper of Fables
</a>. This is a big deal. Yes, the creatures have to have power two or less - but considering that’s the same condition for unblockability it reinforces the cornerstones of our deck. No concerns here. The only downside of course is discarding your whole hand…but I don’t think it’ll be as big a deal as we might think. We can also capitalize on it with cards like 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/141/glint-horn-buccaneer?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/d/f/df2df9cb-14f5-470f-b438-20f4ae8d0d59.jpg?1563899187' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

</a> and 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/c20/4/brallin-skyshark-rider?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/9/b/9b4fdcd5-5346-46a8-b1a4-84ddb74089e0.jpg?1591234217' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Brallin, Skyshark Rider
</a>. Bottomline, when combined with the above ability to make all our creatures unblockable, we’ll be drawing an obscene amount of cards in a color that generally struggles to do so. Take that Sidar Kondo.</p>

<p>So we’ve got a commander that can push through damage AND draw us cards at a consistent rate, we just need to do it on her terms. Meaning we need an army of creatures that are power two or less. In Red. I wonder where we’re going to find them…</p>

Goblins are by nature very low to the ground and annoying little punks which is <em>exactly</em> what we’re looking for. Whether it be through token generation, goblin tutors (which there are a surprising amount of), or just a lot of creatures, we’ll be filling the board quickly and effectively.</p>

<p>Focusing first on the incredible rate at which Goblins produce more goblins, it’s no surprise that most other goblin commanders are potent token generators. Krenko has a long history of bringing an overwhelming force of rage every turn, and while Pashalik is a newer addition to the scene - he’s just as ready to keep cranking out 1/1s. We’ve also got cards like

<h2 id="love-story">Love Story</h2>

<p>In our last Brawl Homebrew (found <a href="/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/05/28/brawldt_2.html">here</a>), we explored the potential of an absolute blast from the past,

	Snapdax, Apex of the Hunt
</a> continued to have the drop on our build making Hanna feel a bit like a liability. While we didn’t lose those games, they were always incredibly close. In fact our only loss was to…</p>

    <div class="text-center">
        <img src="https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/7/2/726e7dc5-2089-4758-93e1-79212aedf75f.jpg?1591605150" style="max-width: 33%;" class="img-fluid" />

<p><br />
<em>Another</em> enchantment and artifact commander, except this one has an extra slew of keywords and doesn’t need to be tapped. It was a bloodbath. Alela and her flock (is a grouping of faeries called a flock? A mischief?) dive-bombed poor Hanna until there was nothing left. Absolute tragedy.</p>

<p>But I know this is not the end Taylor Swift would approve of. No, if she were here she’d say to be Fearless, because in the wise words of the rocker herself, “Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want all over again… even though every time you’ve tried before, you’ve lost.” I can’t let T Swift down. Maybe Hanna just isn’t the right call for enchantments/artifacts in Brawl right now. Perhaps we’ll get more powerful artifact support down the line that will help her become an absolute powerhouse but for now, I need to look elsewhere if I want to succeed with an artifact and enchantment focused build. Maybe to Hanna’s greatest nemesis in the Brawl Guildhall.</p>

<h2 id="look-what-you-made-me-do">Look What You Made Me Do</h2>

<p>That’s right. It’s time to put on our war paint, get our act together, and bring the fight back to Alela. You know what that means:</p>

<p>We’re going to build our own version of the legendary pushed-for-brawl faerie, but <strong>better</strong>, and it’s going to be absolutely awesome! The disappointing days of dropping enchantments and having to wait for them to leave the battlefield to get value from our commander are gone. As soon as Alela hits the field we’ll be filling it with a Mischief (I’ve decided that’s cooler sounding than a flock) of Faeries that don’t know the word “mercy”.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest change to our deck is going to be a flyer subtheme. While Alela creates 1/1 flyers with every enchantment and artifact cast, she <em>also</em> gives all flyers +1/+0 because Alela takes no prisoners…and needed to sell pre-constructed Brawl decks.

	Divine Visitation
</a> is an absolute must for any token theme, trading all our meager 1/1s in for 4/4 Angels, ready to rain down holy hellfire on all those doubters. “In a relationship each person should support the other; they should lift each other up.” Alela provides Divine Visitation with an endless supply of tokens and Visitation makes them the angels they are. It’s a match made in heaven.

	Mire’s Grasp
</a> as our only mono-black one, but that’s to be expected. Elspeth Conquering death is quite a saga, and with that first turn being able to permanently exile someone’s commander or any real threat is truly Better Than Revenge.

	All That Glitters
</a> should win some kind of record for being in all of our enchantment decks to date, but it’s just <em>so good</em> the decision is warranted. Even at its worst, it’ll give a creature +1/+1 and generate a flying 2/1 so I really can’t ever be complaining.</p>

<h2 id="bad-blood">Bad Blood</h2>

<p>But Chev, if we’re putting our faith in Alela what happens when we take the black? Well, a lot actually. Turns out adding black to our available cardpool is a great way to throw in powerful removal. Who knew?!</p>

</a>, we’re able to create a solid board state before Alela even hits the board. Once she hits the board, the pace goes up to 11 as we start generating fliers at insane rates and just keep the fight in the air to close out the game.</p>

<p>In a five-game run we went 4-1, but this loss was incredibly close and was mainly due to drawing nothing but lands for six straight turns.

The excellent folk metal band Windrose once said, “Nobody is safe in a tavern full of drunken dwarves, no respect for humans, dragons, trolls, or pointy ears…” and that’s exactly what we’re aiming for during our Merriment!

                                <p>These days, it’s hard to be a Magic card. Back in the first few years of Magic’s lifespan, there were only a few releases a year. Wizards, as well as the player base were still falling into their stride. Now, any given year, there are three story sets, a core set, a commander product (or several), a masters set, and some other specialty product or innovation set, totaling thousands of new cards. If you’re looking to stand out and carve a niche, especially in older formats, you have to overcome a backlog of over 20,000 cards from a long and storied history of the game.</p>

<p>Wizards has only gotten better at making more powerful and interesting cards, so on average, a card released now will fall by the wayside quickly. It can be even more rough if you’re a rare or mythic rare. With the rarity premium comes pressure to push boundaries either on rate or in design space. And oftentimes these don’t capture the hearts and minds of the players, or they were simply printed at the wrong time, crowded out by cards printed shortly before or after hand.

Stats aside, let’s read on. Impervious Greatwurm also has <em>Convoke</em>, a flagship mechanic of the Conclave that’s made appearances in many Ravnican sets, as well as some supplemental sets. Makes sense thematically, and at a CMC of 10, it’s nice that there’s a way to cheat a bit on the cost. But when it’s already so big, that reduction still seems unfair, especially if I’m using my mindset from when I first started playing and

	Siege Rhino
</a> was a god card.</p>

<p>But that’s not all, there’s one more line of text on the Greatwurm. Hmm let me see here, “Indestructi-..”, <strong>HOLD ON WAIT, WHAT?</strong> You mean, not only is it the beefiest of boys, but I can cheat on its mana cost <em>and</em> it’s <strong>nearly impossible</strong> to get rid of?</p>

<p>Someone tell me why, in the name of whatever god(s) you pray to, be it those of Theros, those of Amonkhet, or the Dragon God Nicol Bolas himself, this majestic beast has suffered such injustice?!?! With rotation coming in only a few months, we <strong>will</strong> make Impervious Greatwurm great again (okay, technically not ‘again’, but ‘for the first time’).</p>

Luckily, when it comes to haymakers like the Greatwurm, we have built-in directions, as well as precedence, on how to call it into the fray. For the Selesnyans, strength comes in numbers and you’ll need a lot of poor suckers to wrangle the Greatwurm in. <em>Convoking</em> has been a solid strategy in the past for things such as

So, <em>convoking</em> allows us to get a reduction on mana cost, but we’re still <em>casting</em> our Greatwurm. That’s way too slow and honest for me, so let’s just cheat him into play! Starting with the strategy’s namesake card, people have been

	Reanimating
</a> the most powerful of creatures since the early days of Magic. Reanimation isn’t as easy to come by as token generation, but there are enough powerful effects to fill out a necromantic package for our guest of honor. Pretty much all necromantic interaction stems from black’s portion of the color pie (with some splashes here or there) and it’s usually going to run you a cool five mana. My choice for best option however, is

	Ilharg, the Raze-Boar
</a>. Purphoros is basically a Sneak Attack on a stick, though having to sacrifice our monstrosity end of turn has always been problematic if we aren’t winning on the spot. Ilharg could be even better as it is a recur-able way to get the wurm into combat, and instead of sacrificing it, returns it to our hand, which sort of protects it. Still, both aren’t the most fool-proof ways to execute our gameplan.</p>

Now that I’ve gone on <em>entirely too long</em> about how to actually get Impervious Greatwurm into play, we need to discuss how to win. You might have noticed that one important word was missing from its textbox: trample. Not being able to bypass defenses means people can chump for days and potentially crack back or find an exile or bounce spell. That’s no bueno for us.

<p>Now, all of these options are <em>plausible</em>, though some more efficient and less far-fetched than others. However, I’m saving what I feel to be the most fool-proof win condition for last. Why bother with trample (we didn’t even discuss unblockability, but trust me that’s an even more convoluted road) when we can go straight to the opponent’s dome? Allow me to introduce a humble two mana red sorcery:

Yes, that’s what this has come to. After all that grandstanding about Impervious Greatwurm getting more love and recognition, we’re sacrificing him for the greater good, martyred for the sake of us climbing the ladder. And that, my friends, is a metaphor, or maybe an actual example of how life isn’t fair.</p>

Standard is now a whole new world (sorta)! It’s situations like these that we live for here at Hexdrinkers; ignoring the norm and blazing paths in the face of the unknown (I’ve been reading <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/" target="_blank">Brandon Sanderson</a> recently, cut me some slack for my bombast). These changes don’t kill all the top-tier decks, and many might flock to the safer tried-and-true strategies emerging from their Companion Winter hibernation, but we at Hexdrinkers like to keep looking forward. A shakeup like this provides opportunities to get wild before things settle into place.</p>

<p>Without further adieu, welcome to a two-for-one edition of <em>Homebrewed</em>.

	Colossus Hammer
</a>. But looking further into the cardpool, there are some interesting and powerful cards pertaining to equipment in the format. Let’s start by discussing with the actual equipment we’ll be using to pound our opponent’s face in.

Our armory only consists of four different cards, but they all serve an important purpose. 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/202/steelclaw-lance?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/a/cafcf909-d726-4bc2-adf6-c12ca242f0c1.jpg?1572490835' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Steelclaw Lance
</a> is the blue collar equipment for our deck, but it’s rate as well as sizeable buff means combat is going to be in our favor. Its (much) bigger brother, 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/223/colossus-hammer?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/f/a/fa35b2b5-3e91-4a6c-90b1-8581b4ecaf8b.jpg?1563899755' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Colossus Hammer
</a>, is arguably a meme cards, but that doesn’t mean it’s gonna stop me from trying to suit somebody up with this and go to town (in all honesty it makes me <strong>more likely</strong> to do that). It, along with the proven powerhouse, 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/120/embercleave?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/a/a/aaae15dd-11b6-4421-99e9-365c7fe4a5d6.jpg?1572490333' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Embercleave
</a>, are our best ways of taking our opponent from 20 to zero.</p>

<p>To combat any retaliation and wrought divine wrath, we have 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/236/shadowspear?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/9/3/939c6e19-4b27-4023-bb9c-ae440f91e21c.jpg?1581481207' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Shadowspear
</a> to cover our bases. Though it’s seen mostly sideboard play since it escaped from the underworld, don’t underestimate it. Between being incredibly cheap to cast and equip and for an aggressive deck like this and giving a creature trample and lifelink to punch through damage while helping us outpace other aggro strategies really helps this gem shine. The anti-hexproof/indestructible ability doesn’t come into play often, but every once in a while it’s clutch, which is just icing on the cake.</p>

<p>So those are the knives we’re bringing to the standard gunfight. Now let’s discuss choosing who will fulfill the prophecy and pull them from the sacred stones.

<p>In order to secure our kingdom, we’ve brought together several powerful knights who curve nicely into each other for a brutal offense. Leading the charge is 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/124/fervent-champion?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/5/c52d66db-5570-48a1-99cf-e0417517747b.jpg?1572490356' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Fervent Champion
</a>. A staple in mono-red decks since their release goes about as fast as you can go. And once multiple attack together the threat level increases even further. However, Fervent Champion has another clause that most people either ignore or don’t even know about: “Equip abilities that target Fervent Champion cost three generic less to activate.” Full stop. That means that cards like Steelclaw Lance, Shadowspear, and an Embercleave that needs to be moved over all equip <em>for free</em> (oh, and that’s also a big chunk off equipping Colossus Hammer)…</p>

<p>… all of which we can grab with 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/1/acclaimed-contender?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/f/b/fb6b12e7-bb93-4eb6-bad1-b256a6ccff4e.jpg?1582021671' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Acclaimed Contender
</a>. I suppose we can’t have anything on the rate of 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/143/goblin-ringleader?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/6/9/6911af4e-4abd-4cf9-8a86-ae5d680c6f12.jpg?1563899199' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Goblin Ringleader
</a> these days, but we’ll take the Contender as they can grab us either another body or an equipment, if our board is in good shape. A full playset of these will help us sift through our deck at a quicker clip and keep the pressure on.</p>

<p>But I did say we were curving nicely, so don’t think I forgot the two-drop slot. To compliment Acclaimed Contender’s digging we have 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/203/stormfist-crusader?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/2/7/27425f2e-e0b2-489d-877d-8257d2026bfd.jpg?1572490842' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Stormfist Crusader
</a> as continual source of card draw, impressive in a Mardu tribe (<strong>Note</strong>: not exactly known for drawing cards). Plus, a 2/2 menace for two ain’t too shabby. Sure our opponent also draws a card, but they’re taking damage and they sure aren’t going to outrace us. Recently brainwashed and conscripted by the evil forces of Rakdos Sacrifice, let’s bring this defender of the realm back to the side of justice.

<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/330/syr-gwyn-hero-of-ashvale?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/a/3/a33add37-379d-4a90-9c04-529dff676986.jpg?1571282693' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Syr Gwyn, Hero of Ashvale
</a>. Though once a hero, but she’s been forced to take an early retirement. Not even Brawl players have taken to this card (probably due to the fact that it costs six, c’mon Wizards you could’ve pushed this card a bit as opposed to so many others), so it’s up to us here at Hexdrinkers to find Syr Gwyn a home (<em>nudge nudge</em> Chev, get on it). Once we can get her onto the field, the Hero of Ashvale is an absolute beast with sizable stats and excellent keywords. Even more importantly she gives us free equips (the Colossus Hammer dream shines a bit brighter) and more card advantage, which is crucial to push a deck like this across the finish line. Rise, and become a Hero once more in our crusade upon a new Standard format!</p>

<p>That’s a capable and sizable army that we’ve recruited, but every army needs support staff; medics, squires, and most importantly, blacksmiths, all round out a successful war effort. Our forces are no different.

<p>Dalakos also must put a little extra spice into his blades giving those who wield them the ability to zoom into the sky providing much needed evasion and speed; he gives them flying and haste.

<p>In addition to weapons, our craftsmen have whipped up something a little more sentient and just as deadly.

<p>That’s the deck, a nice twist on an aggro deck incorporating a recently overlooked tribe and card type. In this new standard aggro decks will be especially potent, so this deck is an out of the box to approach the format. But if you thought that’s all for today, you’re mistaken good friends. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I only gave you one option, so I’ve prepared another deck with not Eldraine at its core, but Theros! This one is another aggro deck because there’s something cathartic about hitting “All Attack” on Arena.</p>

Theros Beyond Death had this series of ‘Hero’ cards that made one helluva Boros aggro deck in draft. With all the auras in the set you could suit up a Hero and what I’d like to dub the ‘Hero Clause’ (a nod to original Theros’s <a href="https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Heroic" target="_blank">‘Heroic’ mechanic</a>) kicks in buffing your whole team. It’s like in any superhero movie where at the edge of defeat, the leader of {insert your favorite named assemblage of superheroes} gives their rousing speech about not giving up and the power of friendship and working together and every gets their energy back plus more to defeat the baddies. Or maybe that was the plot of every Shounen anime ever… Anyway! I thought, why assemble the greatest version of this draft deck ever made and take a whole legion of heroes to war in Standard. And you know how it goes over here at Hexdrinkers, once that thought takes shape, we have to deliver it to y’all, fully fleshed out.</p>

Our creature suite is very streamlined as they’re almost all Heroes. This means they’re a red or white creature that has the Hero Clause: whenever you cast a spell that targets this creature, creatures you control get +1/+0. Wizards has conveniently printed a bevy of heroes for us that curve out nicely.

</a> is a sneaky pick as not only does it remove dangers across the battlefield (and synergizing with our token generation; tapping a creature isn’t a downside when you have so many), but it also <em>targets</em> our creatures so we can buff them! Double whammy, baby.</p>

<p>The recent bannings and rules change have shaken up many formats, especially Standard. The format has been busted wide open in the chaos. It’s time to try new things, have fun brewing, and of course, smash face.</p>

<p>That’s it for this installment of <em>Homebrewed</em>! These decks were fun to craft and I hope y’all pour yourselves a frothing mug of ale, take them into the queues, and fight the good fight. Stay tuned for more content <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/where-find-m21-and-jumpstart-previews-2020-06-02" target="_blank">(M21 spoilers inbound)</a>, stay loving life, and stay brewing!

</a> though, that doesn’t cycle for one mana). It also has all the strength of a raging fire, but dammit it’s not mysterious as the dark side of the moon!</p>

<p>It’s basic and trash. And so am I.</p>

<p>Real talk this deck is dumb, but it’s fun to play and that’s all that matters. If you’re drinking with this deck, please relegate yourself to a <a href="https://trulyhardseltzer.com/">Truly</a> (an inferior seltzer to <a href="https://www.whiteclaw.com/">White Claw</a>) or <a href="https://www.naturallight.com/">Natty Light</a> (which might just be water), you don’t deserve any better.</p>

<p><strong>Editor’s Note: Chev here, this deck brought Julian to Platinum so don’t listen to a word he says. If you want to give this deck a go, get yourself some freaking Champagne and don’t let nobody tell you different. Least of all this dude.</strong></p>

Originally appearing in Invasion, Hanna has a long legacy with the game in both lore and Brawl’s big brother Commander. For you more enfranchised players, I can already see your grins widening at the notion of repeatable graveyard recursion. One only needs to glance at her <a href="https://edhrec.com/commanders/hanna-ships-navigator" target="_blank">EDHRec Page</a> to see the potential of constantly having access to a

<strong>Ashiok’s Erasure</strong> is probably not what comes to anyone’s mind when they think “counter spell”. It’s four mana, doesn’t fully destroy the spell, and feels a little clunky. I mean it’s an

	Heliod’s Punishment
</a> of the format better than we gave them credit for, <em>not a lot of people are running artifact or enchantment removal.</em> So now we’re talking about a card that will exile a potential threat and hey if this gets axed, we can do it again! I’m actually not sure if this is worth including over another counterspell, so if you’re looking for things to tweak this is a fair target. However, in honor of our commander I feel there is a significant thematic boost to including this wild card.</p>

<p><strong>Shark Typhoon</strong> is really a perfect example of a Hanna target. If Shark Typhoon is played as an enchantment your opponent can relive the terror (cheesy, but terror nonetheless) of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-pXDoe5a0E" target="_blank">Sharknado</a>. If you just need a really big flying shark (and really who doesn’t), cycle it and prepare to bring it back with Hanna. All Sharks all the time.</p>

<p><strong>The Birth of Meletis</strong> highlights another key category of cards in our deck: sagas. These enchantments have a limited lifespan, meaning as soon as Hanna is ready we’ll have the ability to start them right over. Coming in at two mana, The Birth of Meletis is certainly the cheapest Saga we have and most likely to be replayed in a consistent fashion. Searching for a land, creating bodies, and gaining a little life is a consistent set of abilities that can’t win on their own…but certainly provide the grease in our recursion machine to keep us in longer games.</p>

<p><strong>Banishing Light</strong> has all the same talking points as Ashiok’s Erasure. It removes a threat from the board and can be a potential target for Hanna if it ends up in the graveyard. Brawl is a format of big monsters, and removal always comes at a premium. Not much more to say about this powerhouse besides it’s an effect we’re quadrupling up on between

<p>Moving on to potential artifact targets, we don’t have many but each fills a very necessary slot for any Brawl deck. We have: graveyard hate, removal, and terrifying threats. What more could you ask for?! Nothing. This is perfect and I love them all.</p>

<strong>Soul-Guide Lantern</strong> fills a familiar role to anyone who’s seen our Brawl builds before: hating on those nasty graveyards. All graveyard strategies are bogus unless we’re the ones currently using it and being able to target a sneaky

	Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger
</a> is an incredible benefit. Get out of here with your shenanigans. Also, in a build like this one we might actually be able to use the Lantern’s second mode and use it to draw the occasional card or two. I doubt you’ll be able to create an endless cycle, but it’s nice to know you have the option.</p>

<p><strong>Meteor Golem</strong> will obliterate anything. No questions asked. Best case, your opponent takes out their vengeance on it’s relatively minor 3/3 body or you can chump, putting Meteor Golem right into the graveyard for Hanna to pick up.</p>

<p><strong>Crystalline Giant</strong> is just a rude card. Slowly building up into an absolute beast or maybe trading as soon as it gets deathtouch. Either way, I’d expect this to be brought back multiple times a game.</p>

<h2 id="other-notable-set-pieces">Other Notable Set Pieces</h2>
<p>Outside of recursion targets, our deck needs a few other powerful payoff cards to build up to. We can’t just rely on our removal and disruption because… well, that’s no fun. We’re playing Brawl, we’re here to fight and take names. So that being said, meet the opponent-might-concede bombs we’re packing.</p>

<p><strong>Dance of the Manse</strong> is our other big payoff for filling the yard with artifacts and enchantments. Unlike Hanna, Dance brings them all back directly to the battlefield. baBOOM! That’s right, we’ll flood the board with used removal, sagas, and one or two artifacts that have the chance to also become an army of 4/4s. Come at us. It should also be noted that any auras returned with  Dance like Heliod’s Punishment or 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/51/ichthyomorphosis?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/4/e4763b6c-6471-41bd-b3e4-785564bcf06f.jpg?1581479371' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Ichthyomorphosis
</a> can get around some pesky punk with hexproof. I don’t see this being a big thing, but it’s worth pointing out! Out-tech your opponents! Anyway, I see Dance as the be-all finisher card that the rest of your deck spends the game preparing to cast.</p>

<p><strong>Cavalier of Dawn</strong> serves as another piece of non-conditional removal, maybe giving our opponent a 3/3 golem or…remember a couple turns ago when you used 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/4/banishing-light?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/a/1/a1ddd113-140f-49c9-b45c-cf1b0d1dffd8.jpg?1581478950' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Banishing Light
</a> on their commander? Commander’s back in the zone, and your enchantment is just sitting on the battlefield with nothing to do. So target that, get a 3/3 Golem for yourself and the ability to exile something else in a couple turns! The most excellent of value. It’s almost too good with the added death trigger allowing you to bring something back to your hand for free. This is easily one of my favorite cards in the deck when played right.</p>

<p><strong>Kiora Bests the Sea God</strong> needs no write-up or speech convincing you why you should include it. 8/8 Hexproof Threat, Tap everything down, and if they’re not dead by then…steal their commander. This will end games, and if it doesn’t, I’m pretty sure your opponent won’t want to stick around for round two.</p>

<p>So that’s it! Let’s see what this deck can get up to!</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>For better or worse, the game has evolved since Hanna first came on the scene. What seems like a pretty powerful ability at first glance may not be as strong as you thought it was. For starters, Hanna needs to see untap before she can even get to her recursion shenanigans and most often commanders are either killed on sight, or countered (which is even worse when it’s<br />

	Tale’s End
</a>). Then, her ability can only be activated once per turn without significant help and you’ll still need to cast whatever you get back. Compared to the likes of

	Muldrotha, the Gravetide
</a>, this seems incredibly too slow in 1v1.</p>

<p>It also makes everything that does provide immediate value, through ETBs or being a blocker, far more enticing to cast each turn. Why play a 1/2 that can do something next turn when I can drop a

</a> that will upgrade on the turn I play it?</p>

<p>This deck went 4-1, but on only one of those wins was Hanna even a factor. Most of the time it was the UW shell that beat our opponents down long enough to either draw a threat or until they concede having no more threats to play. In fact, our one loss came from looking down the barrel of a more modern artifact/enchantment commander who was able to provide utility immediately to her growing army:

</a>. Losing the ability to bring back a couple enchantments per game is made up for in spades with access to black and generating a flying army of fairies that slowly prick you to death. Hanna just couldn’t keep up.</p>

<p>I will give a special highlight to the final game, the one where Hanna actually came out to whoop some ass. It was against

	Elspeth Conquers Death
</a> hit the graveyard and was targeted by a Hanna activation the opponent scooped fearing the constant loop of being conquered ad nauseum. Woohoo! I think Elspeth would be proud of that one.</p>

<p>So overall, this was a good build of UW Enchantment Control that was able to successfully limit the threats of our opponents until we could come up with a win con. While it’s not what I’m typically looking for, it was a lot of fun to play. Hanna kind of served as a nice bonus when she worked, but overall it feels like magic has passed her by. Hopefully she sees a powerful reboot much like the rest of the Weatherlight crew!</p>

<p>So until next time!</p>

No, not that one. Get outta here, this is a Magic site. We’re talking Brawl the <em>format</em> (although I’d completely understand if more of you were familiar with the former.)</p>

<p>My love for Brawl started at the Dominaria prerelease.</p>

It was just after the format was introduced and Dominaria was built for Brawl on a fundamental level. Each pack had a dedicated legendary slot, and the prerelease box came with an extra date-stamped legendary. Originally, I had chalked up Brawl as a one-off way for Wizards to bring the Commander community into the rotating Standard environment and saw Brawl support just as a way to level up some of my 99-card decks…but as I flipped through those six packs of cards, my mind just started forming connections. A limited cardpool lacking “staples” can breed creativity.</p>

I found myself drowning in potential options and was mentally sorting cards into build categories for at least half the deck construction time and spent the rest of the prerelease scheming potential decks in the back of my head. I’m going to pretend that the preoccupation with potential Brawl builds is why I walked away from the event without a win to my name. But who cares!!! I knew exactly what I needed to structure a

<p>After leaving the event, I spent the entire walk home trying to convince my friends to give Brawl a shot. Considering half of them had never even played Magic before that day, I knew I might be facing an uphill battle…but the resistance never came. Maybe it’s the casual nature of multiplayer magic where all four of us could just sit down with a beer or two after a day of class and sling spells at each other. It could also have been the powerful narrative of choosing a specialized general to lead your troops into battle. Either way we all agreed to give it a shot. I was ecstatic.</p>

<p>I met all these guys while studying abroad in New Zealand that semester, so even those of us who had some experience with the game were in a position where no one had any collection of cards to fall back on. Initially, we all just had those prerelease packs. This was incredibly fortunate for the budding playgroup to start on such equal footing, and allowed us to really experiment with combos of cards that otherwise would have seemed ridiculous. Eventually we found a local game store that would give draft chaff to students for free, and maybe we bought a pack or two…but singles were pretty much out of the question. I felt such a strong connection to when my friends back home and I had just started playing in High School. Both metas were defined by low-powered decks with one or two mid-tier rares that were absolutely devastating when dropped. Things like

Luckily this time around, everyone was able to skip the stage of only playing the coolest threats without any answers. If I were to list my all-time favorite Magic memories, that semester in New Zealand playing with low-powered brawl decks would easily be in the top three. It was really a testament to what crafty strategies we could build from the limited pool we had. To give an example of one of my sweetest creations, here is a selection from my

Any equipment that gave just a boost to power was an instant include, making my wild army of blue 2/1s into actual threats (as long as Tetsuko was on the field), and Champion of Wits served as a sweet piece of late game tech to loot away any nasty lands while serving as a reasonable body in the early game.

</a>. Then, maybe we’d go down to Burger Fuel for a bite or end up doing a bit of group studying. It was the perfect pressure release and a time dedicated to seeing friends amongst everyone’s busy schedules.</p>

<p>After that initial Dominaria hype, the community’s love for Brawl also drastically declined. There were a few powerhouse cards that needed to be banned, (see: 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/aer/28/baral-chief-of-compliance?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/6/0/60e16d94-1166-4050-8554-686e153a7f80.jpg?1576381454' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

</a>) and Wizards had only pushed Brawl for that one set so support was severely lacking in Core 19 and Guilds of Ravnica. Sure, there were legendary creatures, but no excitement from the Mothership to spur innovative design in the format. I think one of the final nails in that early coffin was fall rotation, when all the commander players realized why a lot of them had drifted away from rotating formats in the first place…half their deck was no longer usable.</p>

<p>But like all good things, eventually it came to an end. When I returned home, I really struggled to get any of my “killer” brawl designs upgraded into the commander meta. All the strategy and unique designs I’d spent months crafting didn’t really hold a candle to the more powered-up strategies of a legacy cardbase, and I found myself not really wanting to tarnish the memories I had with particular standard cards in favor of pushing a deck out. Since I didn’t have a brawl group anymore my interest in the format really petered, and it seems I wasn’t alone.</p>

<p>Official Support didn’t return until Eldraine over a year <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-preview/new-era-brawl-2019-07-22" target="_blank">later</a>. This time, with preconstructed Brawl decks to really spur momentum. Most demand for these products ended up going towards Commander since at that point the Brawl player base was around two people.

</a> into a beastly 100 card monstrosity. It really took the introduction of Brawl into Arena shortly after to give the format the jump it needed.</p>

<p>Giving Commander players (and a budding Brawl community) a version of their favorite format online was an incredible selling point, and even though Wizards started small (only weekly events and some special occasions to play), the numbers wanting to line up behind their favorite legendary and throw hands only grew.</p>

That of course brings us to the present day.

Think of this legendary character as the general of your forces. The best brawl decks build around the effects of their commander to create a synergy that benefits from constant access to your commander who starts essentially as an eighth card in hand. Also, being a singleton format you only ever need one copy of any given card. This becomes a huge boon when looking at MTGA’s wildcard structure. You don’t really want to be spending 4 wildcards on a playset of

</a>. It gives a lot more flexibility on how to spend your hard-earned wins when you don’t need to buy 4-ofs to be competitive.</p>

<p>That should not dissuade enfranchised players though.The singleton nature of the format creates a landscape much harder to solve since it lacks the consistency of other 60-card formats. Finding ways to enact a successful game plan across multiple matches is an incredible puzzle to solve.</p>

<h2 id="brawls-official-rules">Brawl’s Official Rules</h2>
<p>Unlike Commander, whose rules are handled by an external entity to Wizards, <a href="https://mtgcommander.net/" target="_blank">The Rules Committee</a>, Wizards handles Brawl in-house and can provide the most in-depth description of the various mechanical specifics <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/brawl" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Brawl functions almost exactly like Commander, so if you’re a recent convert from Brawl’s big older brother the TLDR is your commander can be either a standard-legal legendary creature OR Planeswalker, and the starting life total for 1-on-1 is 25. It goes up to 30 for games of more than 2 people which I did not know…until I was doing research for this article.</p>

<p>For those of you more unfamiliar with Commander…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your Commander is a Legendary Creature or Planeswalker who starts outside the game, meaning your initial deck is only 59 cards.</li>
  <li>All cards in your deck must fit into the color identity of your Commander. If your commander is a Simic creature, all spells in your deck must be blue, green, both, or colorless. The easy way to check this is if any other mana symbol outside of what’s on your commander shows up ANYWHERE on a card - you can’t use it. MTGA will also help and notify you of illegal cards if you choose one.</li>
  <li>Your first mulligan is free, so the first time you decide to shuffle your hand back into your deck - you draw seven cards again. After that, it follows normal London Mulligan rules</li>
  <li>Perhaps the biggest new concept is this idea of the “Command Zone” i.e. where your Commander starts the game. Basically, it’s a special place where you can cast your commander from any time you could cast them from your hand. The benefit is, any time your commander would be moved from one zone to another (battlefield to exile, graveyard to exile, hand to graveyard, etc.) …you can choose to have them sent BACK to the Command zone instead! Making sure you always have access to what is probably your greatest weapon. Now, this does come at a cost though: Each time your commander is sent back to the command zone, it’ll cost two more generic mana to cast the next time. This is called Commander Tax and balances some of the benefit of always having your commander accessible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="brewing">Brewing</h2>
<p>Since Brawl is a much newer format than Commander, and due to the lack of content produced in 2019 until Eldraine about the format…there aren’t nearly as many resources available if you’re looking for ideas. Initially, EDHRec had an entire site dedicated to Brawl but as of right now that still hasn’t come back. Luckily, <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/brawl#paper" target="_blank">MTGGoldfish</a> and a couple others can offer some ideas on what people are currently playing. I’d be careful starting with a net deck though! It can be difficult to make your own connections between cards after seeing something you might consider as “better.” Always scheme out your own idea first, maybe focusing on just cards already in your collection - and use these sites as ways to upgrade or add new things. Or, if you really just want to jump in at a competitive level all decks on MTGGoldfish are listed with their popularity in the current meta.</p>

<p>Once you have a Commander in mind…Here are some tips that might help you on your journey to build the ultimate 60-card temple to badassitude.</p>

<p><strong>Your Commander should be built around:</strong> With the recent focus on legendary creatures to the benefit of both Commander and Brawl, there are a huge selection of generals to choose from - and your deck should  hone in on what your commander does best. Goodstuff is a viable strategy, but generally building something that focuses on your Commander’s unique identity will benefit you even more. For example, recently I’ve started building a

<p><strong>Get Arcane Signet and Command Tower:</strong> You wouldn’t have gotten these in packs, but they’re so incredibly powerful and should probably go in every deck you make. Plus, they’re both <em>commons</em> and I cannot think of a more powerful impact that can be made by literally any other cards legal in the format. Get yourself some incredibly cheap mana fixing to offset the cost of buying/crafting a shock land.</p>

<p><strong>Take Rotation Into account:</strong> Brawl does have the same looming threat as Standard. Come Fall, how many of my cards will still be useful? This can be an incredibly annoying thought when first starting in the format but shouldn’t be something that you worry too much about. Apart from the occasional Historic Brawl event, maybe you do want to focus your efforts on including cards from Eldraine, Theros Beyond Death, and Ikoria. I will admit though, the sacrifice of one mythic wildcard for a

	Hydroid Krasis
</a> …is definitely one worth making. You still have like six months to enjoy its absurdity, and your deck would be better for it!</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>watch streams!</strong> Like with any other format, you can learn a lot from watching other people play the Brawl decks they’ve meticulously created and care about - see synergies and ideas for their decks that you didn’t even think of. I suppose this is also the point where I should shamelessly plug our streams - where personally, I’ll be playing a fair bit of brawl in the coming days and hopefully this article will convince Julian to join in as well…</p>

With Companions being ubiquitous in Magic today (and what appears to be a sweeping ban announcement on the horizon), I decided to adopt the “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em” mindset and give a speculative final hurrah to one lucky Ikorian. Today’s Companion of choice is none of those I’ve mentioned above. However, it shares a spot with Lurrus as the only other Companion to have faced a ban so far:

Zirda is my personal favorite of all the companions. First, this fox is hella cute. If it wasn’t made of fire, I’d wanna be cuddling it pronto. Zirda also encourages activated abilities which I think are an underrated and underutilised part of magic. People want the instant gratification of an ETB, but properly building around activated abilities can accrue a crushing amount of advantage turn after turn. Lastly, Zirda is a Boros Commander who doesn’t care about the combat step.. okay maybe a little considered its own ability, but it doesn’t scream, “Attack Attack Attack” like an

<p>As I said, Zirda, like Lurrus, has a banning under its belt. It was recently stricken from Legacy likely due to the prevalence of

</a> allowing for infinite mana, which tends to win games. Since we’re adhering to the motto of ‘joining’ not ‘beating’, infinite mana sounds like a good idea to me too! “But Julian,” you may be asking yourself, “surely if there was an easy way to go infinite in Standard, we would have already seen it!” The answer is elementary, my dear Watsons. There isn’t an <em>easy</em> way, but there is <em>a</em> way. Real talk, it took me a few whole days of research to put the combo of making infinite mana together and then another couple days to put together some ways to win with it.<br />
<br /></p>
<h1 id="zirubeda-goldberg">Zi’Rube’da Goldberg</h1>
<p><br />
First let’s discuss the combo itself. Just like Zirda’s interaction with the monoliths, or looking to cards like 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/roe/91/training-grounds?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/2/e2cf16f8-6e69-46b3-8453-1d1a2a5670e2.jpg?1586358076' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Training Grounds
</a>, the key to generating infinite mana is a loop of tapping and untapping that will net you mana each iteration. The only card in Standard that allows this iterative ability of untapping is this uncommon gem from Core Set M20: 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/17/gauntlets-of-light?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/d/a/da0d5436-b881-45ac-b8ec-248d88714021.jpg?1563898291' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Gauntlets of Light
</a>. Now, as much as the Hexdrinkers appreciates big butts, we only care about the second clause: the untap ability for two and a white. Three mana is a bit much to pay to untap though, luckily Zirda gives us a discount so we only need to pay one white mana to untap! But there are still a lot of unanswered questions…

</a> are two of the most versatile mana producers in standard. Not only can they produce any color you might need (and we are running four colors) but they both have the potential to tap for <strong>multiple</strong> mana. Faeburrow Elder taps for green and white just by itself and can add even more colors depending on what we have out. Incubation Druid can only get one color of mana at a time, but after it adapts it’s still a

</a> with legs, which is not shabby. Not to mention, Zirda’s static ability can give us an early adapt.</p>

<p>So now we’ve assembled our combo. With Zirda and either Faeburrow Elder or an adapted Incubation Druid suited up with the Gauntlets of Light, we can tap for two or three (or four if we’re lucky) and then untap for a single white, netting us mana. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum. Excellent, we have as much mana as we could want in any combination of colors! Now what?

With our combo we can have an arbitrarily (read, ‘infinitely’) large amount of mana which means we have an arbitrarily (read, ‘infinitely’) large Brushwagg.</p>

Now, some of you may have noticed the elephant in the room. Zirda, as a Companion, has a deck building restriction: all permanents in our starting deck must have activated abilities. Faeburrow Elder and Incubation Druid have their mana abilities. Brushwagg has its pump ability. But Gauntlets of Light… well, it <em>gives</em> the untap ability to the creature it enchants, so it doesn’t pass the test. But, as it is the linchpin of our combo, we need to find a loophole. What if, instead of it being in our starting deck, it were in our <strong>sideboard</strong>? That adheres to regulations. Now, we just have to retrieve it, and nobody does the job better than

Playing four Fae of Wishes to grab our Gauntlets from the sideboard may seem a little extra, but it’s necessary for the sake of the combo, which is admittedly extra in itself, but “you are what you brew” or however that saying goes. I did take this chance to utilize the sideboard a bit more and placed an additional copy of Fling and Ram Through there, as well as a

</a> fixes our mana and wishes it was Faeburrow Elder or Incubation Druid. Definitely feel free to customize the sideboard with whatever silver bullets are appropriate, or just more redundancy.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this deck is fragile. It’s built for finding our pieces consistently and quickly. Disruption is not our friend. Also, the one-of, or sideboard nature of our win conditions is a gamble that I had to take in order to make the deck run on all cylinders. Lastly, the manabase was hard to decide on since we’re playing four colors and our pieces are all over the spectrum. Luckily our dorks can fix our mana pretty good, so I’m not extremely concerned.</p>

And that’s the deck! This one was a crazy puzzle to fit together and though I doubted its competitive viability, we did go 2-3! After getting beat down by super aggressive decks that went under us, getting that combo off for the first time was exhilarating. The second time was just as good because we fought our way through a

Lastly, the only drink I recommend for this deck is one you’re comfortable pouring out for the looming loss of Zirda and all the Companions.</p>

<p>No frills, no mixers, no long write-up. The decks featured in this series don’t need that. These are simply decks that we <em>want to play</em> and we figured we’d share the experience.</p>

<p>This first installment is no different - Selesnya Auras. Suit up your creatures with only the finest of fineries and then gracefully waltz into the chaos that is the combat step. We have auras that pump, auras that give keywords, creatures that care about auras, creatures that care about enchan-… Ah jeez, I’m monologuing again aren’t I? After I just said no long write-ups…</p>

<p>Just watch the video already. (Chev joins me for this one. If you like this, check out his <a href="/enter%20the%20guildhall/2020/05/14/brawldt_1.html">Selesnya Auras Brawl deck tech</a>)</p>

</a> illustrates a tale as old as time: the maturation of an orphan into a bloodthirsty killing machine swearing to avenge their fallen parent. It reminds me of what Bambi could have been if Disney weren’t cowards, or maybe more accurately, a little known Japanese animation called Ringing Bell. It’s the tale of a sheep who goes on a quest to avenge his mother who was killed by a wolf, becoming a savage ram who has horns like spears and actually duels the wolf in the end. Highly recommended, but I digress.</p>

<p>You know what could’ve helped out our woodland friends? An enter-the-battlefield trigger. Which is precisely what we’re looking for.

	Offspring’s Revenge
</a> is an excellent way to rebuy ETBs and attack triggers since it gives our vengeful babies haste. The glaring downside of the tokens being 1/1’s is no longer so much of an issue if we can maximize these two types of triggers to our advantage.</p>

<p>I did a LOT of research for this article and let’s just say that there is a ridiculous number of creatures in standard with ETBs (and a fair amount with attack triggers too). Overcome with options and ideas, I figured we would have our cake and eat it too and I prepare a buffet of decks to choose from:</p>

<p>Drakuseth costs a fat seven mana, so instead of paying mana like an honest spellslinger let’s reanimate the big scaly bastard. Oh, and he has haste, so we’ll be dealing three and three and four, <em>immediately</em>. Drakuseth is great for gunning down our opponents creatures, whether that’s blockers, utility, or ones who’ll crack back at us.</p>

<p>I recommend pairing something dark to drink with this deck. An Imperial stout such as <a href="https://victorybeer.com/beers/">Victory’s Storm King</a> has a hefty weight to it and will warm up your icy soul. Or you could take a page out of our Queen Ayara’s playbook and settle with a dark, dry, red wine… or is that blood? Uh … n-nevermind.</p>

<p>Standard right now is an absolute wonderland when it comes to mana. We have ridiculous color pair support from Return to Return to Ravnica block, complimented by the full set of temples finished in Theros Beyond Death. And we also have shard support and the triomes from Ikoria. Even Throne of Eldraine gave us a crucial mana fixer in

</a>! So, when the world is our oyster, why would we limit our revenge to merely <em>three colors</em>? Yes. I’m talking a full <em>rainbow</em> of revenge.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier in the article, when I was researching for this article, I looked at any creature that we could recur, so any creature that has red, white, or black in it, but including any of the other colors. There are a lot of interesting and powerful creatures once you open up your color combos, and since I want to play all of them, this deck has a toolbox sensibility. We’re even using

<p>Pretty neat right? Not only are you getting value as soon as Siona hits the battlefield, being able to “tutor” for a useful aura but also enabling a token sub strategy is not a bad plan B. The cost of throwing an

</a>), and the ramp package to be able to play the bigger auras and the consistency of a turn-two Siona… I found much less room for creativity than I would have liked. Some of this could be an amount of creative burnout being fresh off a stint of upgrading most of my other commander decks - maybe Siona was just schemed at the wrong time - but it gave me the glimmer of an idea that you’re about to see the results of.</p>

<p>What about putting together a Selesnya aura brawl deck? The restricted cardpool could really be a boon to the creativity required, and enable us to have a more unique experience with oh captain our captain. Enough talk though, let’s tech.</p>

<p>We’ve got a pretty impressive lineup available thanks to Theros’s heavy enchantment theme, and a couple powerful standouts from Ikoria and Eldraine. Let’s see the heaviest hitters:</p>

	Ethereal Armor
</a>. Unfortunately, trading first strike for growing off of artifacts is not really helpful for us here but being able to directly benefit from every aura and other enchantment we play is reason enough to include this. With any luck, the high number of other auras and enchantment creatures will let this serve as a cheaper copy of our next highlight…</p>

<p><strong>Colossification</strong> I mean damn, there’s not really much to be said for an aura that hands out +20/+20 besides I hope we can get it on something with trample. It’ll be interesting to see how often this is actually allowed to come down or put in work since the rest of our curve is relatively low. But in the event of a long game, having this big a finisher in your corner ain’t bad.</p>

<p><strong>Hydra’s Growth</strong> trades Colossification’s significant mana cost for a time investment, being able to easily reach and surpass +20/+20 in the more durable form of +1/+1 counters, but taking a few turns to get there. Hydra’s growth has been an absolute powerhouse in every limited deck I made during the THB season and it’ll be interesting to see how this shapes up in Brawl. I personally think it’ll become a kill on-sight card which is certainly nice to draw attention if we’ve got anything else we need a distraction from.</p>

<p><strong>Warbriar Blessing</strong> is one of our few forms of removal. White certainly doesn’t have the suite of cheap removal available to it in eternal formats, and besides a couple higher cost instants this might be one of the best chances to stay on theme and pop one of our opponent’s creatures. We’ll see if the benefits outweigh the costs though…</p>

<p>But of course, what good are all-star auras without all-star targets to enchant? We need a strong creature base to support our theme and I think these guys have what it takes to go pro:</p>

<p><strong>Archon of Sun’s Grace</strong> could stand on its own as a 3/4 flyer with lifelink for 4 as a potential target to drop a Colossification on, but add on the Constellation trigger to create MORE flyers with lifelink? What?! It’s like…that’s our strategy or something! Anyway you’ll never be disappointed by drawing this card, at any point in the game.</p>

<p><strong>Paradise Druid</strong> is a great example of what I consider a long-term investment. Upfront, it can give you a lil mana, get you dropping threats early, but later….you’ve got a creature with conditional hexproof. While you still need to navigate around its loss of hexproof on tap, there’s a lot to be said for equipping Paradise Druid with

	Sentinel’s Eyes
</a> and any other enchantment in your deck to build your own hexproof threat. Just be careful and remember 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/148/colossification?utm_source=api" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/7/b/7b6e6f2a-5015-44c6-aa8d-85188494d1a6.jpg?1585927210' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
	Colossification
</a> taps your creature, which would render Paradise Druid vulnerable for a turn.</p>

<p><strong>Lavabrink Venturer</strong> takes what makes Paradise Druid good and turns it to 11… conditionally. Remember that Protection also protects Lavabrink from your stuff so be incredibly careful about choosing Odd, since that’ll prevent it from being a target of either Colossification, Hydra’s Growth, or Sentinel’s Eyes. Just something to consider. Either way, still incredibly powerful if you have the wildcard to spend.</p>

<p><strong>Setessan Champion</strong> is what I’d call an undeniable team player. Regardless of who gets the aura you’re playing, Setessan Champion still gets a +1/+1 counter AND draws you a card. That’s some incredible value on a 3-drop, especially considering they’ll also trigger on any enchantment creature or other enchantment you’re playing. Green and White are not known for their card draw, so a repeatable draw engine that also plays along with our deck theme is something I’d even consider in a Siona commander build.</p>

As much as I’d love to wage an all-out assault of auras, we do need to be prepared for the inevitable: our opponent will want to play creatures and stuff as much as we do. This is where the second type of aura in our deck comes in.</p>

<p><strong>Trapped in the Tower</strong>, while conditional, is really worth the two mana. It won’t be able to hit any form of Niv-Mizzet, but clamping down on an indestructible God or any other beast without wings is of incredible benefit. It also has the clause negating activated abilities which puts this over

<p><strong>Kenrith’s Transformation</strong> is the latest in a long line of such transformations that I had thought were supposed to be in Blue’s part of the color pie.  It’s not as powerful as

	Imprisoned in the Moon
</a>, but is still incredibly useful at stopping a threat. It even replaces itself!  While testing the deck I did manage to cast this on Kenrith himself, so, that was a huge flavor win.</p>

	Dreadful Apathy
</a> for a similar reason of Trapped in the Tower over pacifism: the stifling of annoying abilities. Does it have a four turn clock? Sure, but hopefully you’ll get something else by then. While Dreadful Apathy can deal with the threat more permanently at six mana, I’ll gladly take this trade. Especially when targeting a commander who they’d potentially be able to replay if it weren’t stuck on the battlefield.</p>

Welcome to Rev Your Engines, the series where we utilize unique engine enchantments to kick standard into high gear! Will we have a highly tuned engine to take us 
across the finish line or will we sputter and stall out? (I simultaneously hated and loved making those puns)

With the right build, Titan’s Nest falls firmly in the “busted” category and I think it could be a major player in standard once rotation comes in the fall. Just 
reading the card, we essentially give all our spells delve (a mechanic that has gotten cards banned in many formats). Yes, there are some restrictions, no X-spells, 
only mono-colored spells, but

<p>
Titan’s Nest is also full on Sultai (hooray for the return of wedge support), colors that happen to love putting milling themselves for all sorts of benefit.
On the surface, this enchantment can turn our graveyard into a source of ramp to keep our foot on the gas in the mid to late game. But that’s boring. Like I said 
earlier, this enchantment should not be treated as a fair card, and I intend to use it solely for the forces of evil.

Syr Konrad was a powerhouse in Throne of Eldraine limited, but in constructed formats he’s been generally overlooked. Some of that might be because he has more lines of 
text than War and Peace… or more likely because he was turned into an elk. TLDR, any time creatures are entering or leaving the graveyard, Syr Konrad is gonna ping our 
opponent. They want to wrath, they'll take a bunch of damage. They mill some of our beloved troops, they get pinged a few times. If creatures are banished to the shadow 
realm (whoops wrong card game) by Titan’s Nest to generate loads of colorless mana…. they take damage for Every. Single. One.

That is our dastardly scheme in a nutshell: mill as much of our deck as possible, get a Syr Konrad and Titan’s Nest on the field and huck a putrid fireball from 
beyond the grave.

Syr Konrad doesn’t discriminate. Merfolk, Bird, Gorgon… Wall? He’ll take every helping hand/fin/brick he can get. The common thread among this creature suite is 
that all these creatures mill us, fueling our Nest and triggering Konrad if he’s out. We’re looking at three to four cards binned per creature we play which adds up 
very quickly. While there are cards that could self-mill more efficiently in standard, we need a high density of creatures to enact our combo kill. These creatures all 
come with upside in that they pad our life total or block incredibly well. <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/102/gorging-vulture" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/3/7/37cbe5f2-5b6b-41de-9586-c7cc83464cf2.jpg?1563898929' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

    Tamiyo, Collector of Tales
</a> a lot. It’s a versatile card, especially with graveyard strategies. It can dig for our combo pieces, milling us more in the process, or regrow things that we milled 
earlier. We don’t want to dilute our creature count and at four mana, it’s on the higher end of our curve, but I thought trying one out could be interesting.

    Corpse churn

    The Binding of the Titans
</a> was a card that intrigued me at release, but never really found a home in any of my decks until now. Given, it takes some turns, but 
this card is a powerhouse for us. It mills us, it gains life and allows us to pick off a lurking <a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/229/uro-titan-of-natures-wrath" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/a/0/a0b6a71e-56cb-4d25-8f2b-7a4f1b60900d.jpg?1581481163' width=100% height=100%&gt;">

    Lurrus of the Dream-Den
</a> target. Nice. In chapter three we even get to 
fix our mana or, like Corpse Churn, get back a creature we may need or our fearless leader, Syr Konrad. And then after all that, we can exile the Binding to our Titan’s 
Nest to play our other spells.

    Tymaret Calls the Dead
</a> as a one-of is just a catch-all slot. It mills more than our other cards, albeit over multiple turns, gains us some life at the end, 
and if you can exile an already spent Binding, we can get an additional blocker (or attacker if our opponent is playing a creature-light deck).
</p>
<p>
The mana base is mostly basics, just to keep it simple. We want to be going as fast as possible, we cannot wait for tap lands. Add a few shocks and 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/244/fabled-passage" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/b/8/b841bfa8-7c17-4df2-8466-780ab9a4a53a.jpg?1572491204' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
    Fabled Passage
</a>s to fix and season to taste.
</p>

<h2 id="the-scheme-is-foolproof">The Scheme is Foolproof!</h2>

<p>
The plan is simple, mill yourself as fast possible. Use as much or all of your mana every turn and get those cards in your graveyard. Always keep a track of how many 
creatures are in there so you know when you’ve reached critical mass. Also, keep track of where your Konrads and Nests are. We need those to win the game, so if you get 
a chance to nab one back from the yard, get it. As you’re playing your creatures out, block aggressively. We want to conserve our life total as best we can, and we lose 
nothing from an additional creature in the bin. Also, don’t be afraid to attack! Getting chip-ins is critical to lessening the threshold needed for Konrad to do his 
thing. Most of our creatures attack well, so get in there if it’s free.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this deck comes with some drawbacks, so let’s discuss what might endanger our victory. Like most combo decks, this deck is incredibly linear and there’s 
no real interaction for us besides blocking, so a counterspell can hinder us. Also, any sort of exile really hurts. 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/13/elspeth-conquers-death" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/a/ea20208b-1939-4c69-8cfd-c0a42f9dc427.jpg?1586801037' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
    Elspeth Conquers Death
</a> hits both our main pieces and something like 
<a class="accented-link" target="_blank" href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/91/elspeths-nightmare" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="&lt;img src='https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/3/7/37ccd974-d2bc-4fcf-94a7-0a868a04cb98.jpg?1586801044' width=100% height=100%&gt;">
    Elspeth’s Nightmare
</a> is a nightmare for us as well wiping out all the progress we’ve made. Sometimes we just won’t draw Titan’s Nest and Syr Konrad, or we’ll mill them. Lastly, we 
realistically can’t deal much more than twenty damage, so any deck that has lots of life gain can be a problem. But these are issues that plague all but the most 
resilient of combo decks and they’re risks that we’ll take to play this ridiculous yet beautiful brew. 
</p>
<p>
On the flip-side, this deck is not a tier deck. Opponents won’t see their demise coming until it’s too late. And since our pseudo delve is a mana ability, they can’t 
stop it and we can do everything immediately at instant speed! There’s nothing like stacking up 20 Syr Konrad triggers up and letting them machine-gun down our 
bewildered opponent. 
</p>
<p>
If you ever go to play this deck yourself, I recommend cracking open a nice sour beer. Konrad is truly EVIL ("Every Villian is Lemons") plotting in the Titan's Nest, and lemons are quite sour. Two of my favorites are 
<a href="http://www.druthersbrewing.com/beer/the-dare-gose">Druthers' Dare</a> 
and 
<a href="https://www.dogfish.com/brewery/beer/seaquench-ale">Dogfish Head's Seaquench</a>.

                                <p>Ladies, gentlemen, boys and girls… Welcome Welcome Welcome! We’re incredibly excited to announce the launch of a brand new platform chock full of incredible Magic the Gathering content brought to you by some of the freshest voices in Magic. This is our first time doing anything of the sort, so we’re basically fresh off the boat.</p>

<h2 id="a-lil-history-lesson">A Lil’ History Lesson</h2>
<p>Our playgroup was founded in 2015, narrowly avoiding a fate of Yu-Gi-Oh thanks to some quick thinking by the proprietor of a local game shop. Since then, Magic has become a way for us to stay together and continue to foster a friendship that has since endured through our college experiences and continues to develop as we enter into the professional world and our adult lives.</p>

<h2 id="whats-our-angle">What’s Our Angle?</h2>
<p>For us, Magic has always been a force inspiring unity. Spending each school break when we’re all together whipping out new and exciting builds for a night of Commander, drinking beer and swapping stories. Or driving across state lines to meet up for midnight prereleases. There are endless tales like this for us, as I’m sure there are for many of you.We want to share those experiences and memories with you and hear yours, all while toasting our favorite beverages.</p>

<p>Countless outlets exist to get every type of Magic fix available.
<a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/" target="_blank">MTGGoldfish</a>,

<a href="https://www.coolstuffinc.com/" target="_blank">CoolStuffInc</a>, and
<a href="https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/" target="_blank">Hipsters of the Coast</a> all provide great content. We enjoy serving up competitive analysis and meta discussion, but we also want to provide a window into how we experience magic and how it has been an outlet of creativity for us. We found that magic is not only a game, but a way to communicate. It could be explaining your incredibly convoluted and “totally tier 1” combo you assembled to your friends around the kitchen table, or just discussing all the hot spoilers that’ll slot into your commander decks around the campfire.  These holistic experiences that most people would tell you are their favorite memories of the game should be shared with joy: and we want to bring that to all of you. Best Commanders to play during a night of drinking? How is crafting a deck like making Homebrew? Which of our decks have aged like fine wines and which went down the hatch quick like a shot of bottom tier vodka. Every game and every card has its own story. We’d love for you to join us in recanting this all. Grab a drink and shuffle up!</p>

<h2 id="meet-our-founders">Meet our Founders:</h2>

<p><strong>Chev Eldrid</strong> - Having just completed a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Chev is eager to develop his skills in both software development and Magic content creation. He’ll be bringing you content on Brawl, Commander, and some streaming in the upcoming weeks with a couple series soon to be announced. Chev is probably also responsible for anything broken on the site so he’s the person to contact for that.</p>

<p><strong>Julian Leal</strong> - A recent graduate of the University of Maryland, Julian has spent the last year developing his professional career as a Geologist. Though he’s most at home playing Commander, Julian has also spent this time striving to branch into all other constructed formats and brewing around anything and everything. Expect brews and competitive decks in Standard, a delve into Historic, and the occasional foray into limited (plus whatever other debauchery he can sneak past Chev). Julian will also be streaming, hopefully regularly.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by! I know we look small now but I promise, we’re just getting started.</p>
